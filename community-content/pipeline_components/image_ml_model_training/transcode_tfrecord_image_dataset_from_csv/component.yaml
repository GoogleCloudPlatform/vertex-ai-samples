name: Transcode imagedataset tfrecord from csv
description: |
  Transcodes CSV Data into TFRecord file of TFExamples.
  Args:
    csv_image_data_path (str):
        Path to the CSV image data. Data must include 'image_filepath' (Path to image file) and
        'image_label' (output for a prediction) fields.
    class_names (Sequence[str]):
        Sequence of strings of categories for classification corresponding to input data.
    tfrecord_image_data_path (str):
        Output path for the TFRecord image data. Data will be formatted as 'label' (encoded image
        label), and 'image_raw' (the binary string of the image data).
inputs:
- {name: csv_image_data_path, type: ImageDatasetCSV, description: Input path for the
    CSV image data}
- {name: class_names, type: 'typing.List[str]', description: List of class names corresponding
    to the input image data}
outputs:
- {name: tfrecord_image_data_path, type: ImageDatasetTFRecord, description: Output
    path for the TFRecord image data}
