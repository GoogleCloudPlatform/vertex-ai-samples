        "# AlphaFold On Vertex AI Workbench\n",
        "\n",
        "[Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench) offers an end-to-end notebook-based production environment that can be preconfigured with the runtime dependencies necessary to run AlphaFold on Vertex AI. With [User-Managed Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/user-managed/introduction), you can configure a GPU accelerator to run AlphaFold using Tensorflow, without having to install and manage drivers or JupyterLab instances. This notebook allows you to easily predict the structure of a protein using a slightly simplified version of [AlphaFold v2.1.0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2). \n",

        "**Differences to AlphaFold v2.1.0**\n",
        "\n",
        "In comparison to AlphaFold v2.1.0, this notebook notebook uses **no templates (homologous structures)** and a selected portion of the [BFD database](https://bfd.mmseqs.com/). We have validated these changes on several thousand recent PDB structures. While accuracy will be near-identical to the full AlphaFold system on many targets, a small fraction have a large drop in accuracy due to the smaller MSA and lack of templates. For best reliability, we recommend instead using the [full open source AlphaFold](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/), or the [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).\n",
        "\n",
        "**This notebook has an small drop in average accuracy for multimers compared to local AlphaFold installation, for full multimer accuracy it is highly recommended to run [AlphaFold locally](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold#running-alphafold).** Moreover, the AlphaFold-Multimer requires searching for MSA for every unique sequence in the complex, hence it is substantially slower. If your notebook times-out due to slow multimer MSA search, we recommend running AlphaFold locally.\n",
