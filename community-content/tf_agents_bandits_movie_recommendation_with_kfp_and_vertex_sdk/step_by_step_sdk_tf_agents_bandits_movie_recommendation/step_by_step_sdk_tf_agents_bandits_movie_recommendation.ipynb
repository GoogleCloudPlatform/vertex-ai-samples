        "## Overview\n",
        "This demo showcases the use of [TF-Agents](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) in building a movie recommendation system with reinforcement learning. The demo is intended for developers interested in creating reinforcement learning applications using TensorFlow and the TF-Agents library, leveraging Vertex AI services (including custom training, custom prediction, model deployment over managed endpoints, and prediction fetching). It is recommended for developers to have familiarity with basic reinforcement learning theory, particularly the contextual bandits formulation, and the TF-Agents interface. Note that contextual bandits form a special case of RL, where the actions taken by the agent do not alter the state of the environment. “Contextual” refers to the fact that the agent chooses among a set of actions while having knowledge of the context (environment observation).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset\n",
        "This demo uses the [MovieLens 100K](https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset) dataset to simulate an environment with users and their respective preferences. It is available at `gs://cloud-samples-data/vertex-ai/community-content/tf_agents_bandits_movie_recommendation_with_kfp_and_vertex_sdk/u.data`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "In this notebook, you will learn how to build a TF-Agents (particularly the bandits module) based reinforcement application using the custom training, custom prediction and endpoint deployment services of Vertex AI.\n",
        "For custom training, you will implement on-policy training, in which you actively interact with a simulation environment based on MovieLens to (1) obtain environment observations, (2) choose actions using the data-collecting policy given the observations, and (3) obtain environment feedback in the form of rewards that correspond to (1)(2). These pieces of data form the training data records. This process is different from off-policy training, where you do not necessarily have training data asscociated with the actual actions outputted by the policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "This demo consists of 2 main steps:\n",
        "1. Run locally with a [TF-Agents](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents) implementation.\n",
        "2. Execute in [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the training, prediction and prediction workflow, the demo also showcases the following optimizations:\n",
        "1. Hyperparameter tuning with Vertex AI\n",
        "2. Profiling of the training process and resources with TensorBoard Profiler, which can inform designs for purposes like speed improvements, scaling\n",
        "\n",

This is because: The prediction task is a standalone request that doesn't require prior knowledge of the system state. Meanwhile, end users only know what they observe at the moment. Reward is a piece of information that comes after the action has been made, so the end users would not have knowledge of said reward. In handling prediction requests, you create a [`TimeStep`](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents/trajectories/TimeStep) object (consisting of `observation`, `reward`, `discount`, `step_type`) using the [`restart()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/api_docs/python/tf_agents/trajectories/restart) function which takes in an `observation`. This function creates the *first* TimeStep in a trajectory of steps, where reward is 0, discount is 1 and step_type is marked as the first timestep. In other words, each prediction request forms the first `TimeStep` in a brand new trajectory.\n",
        "- For the prediction response, avoid using NumPy-typed values; instead, convert them to native Python values using methods such as [`tolist()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.tolist.html) as opposed to `list()`.\n",
        "- There exists a prestart script in `src/prediction`. FastAPI executes this script before starting up the server. The `PORT` environment variable is set to equal `AIP_HTTP_PORT` in order to run FastAPI on the same port expected by Vertex AI."

        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "### What exactly is the purpose of the MovieLens simulation environment?\n",
        "\n",
        "The MovieLens environment *simulates* real-world environment containing users and their respective preferences. Internally, the MovieLens simulation environment takes the user-by-movie-item rating matrix and performs a `RANK_K` matrix factorization on the rating matrix, in order to address the sparsity of the matrix. After this construction step, the environment can generate user vectors of dimension `RANK_K` to represent users in the simulation environment, and is able to determine the approximate reward for any user and movie item pair. In RL's language, user vectors are observations, recommended movie items are actions, and approximate ratings are rewards. This environment therefore defines the RL problem at hand: how to recommend movies that maximize user ratings, in a simulated world of users with their respective preferences defined by the MovieLens dataset, while having zero knowledge of the internal mechanism of the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note here the user vectors may not be in the same dimension as in the original rating matrix, and the approximate ratings (to address the sparsity of rating data) may not equal the original ratings. The individual entries in the user vectors do not correspond to real-world meanings, such as user age, etc.. In prediction requests, the observations are user vectors that lie in the same space as those generated by the MovieLens simulation environment. In other words, they represent users in the same way as the user vectors/observations generated by the MovieLens environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason why this demo adopts the MovieLens environment is to base itself on a public dataset without needing to communicate with the real world; such communication adds overhead to the necessary steps of the demo and likely relies on a specific implementation that is difficult to generalize to your production requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to apply this demo in production\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 0: Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "Walk through this demo, which uses the MovieLens simulation environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Offline Simulation\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the performance of your RL model, you may need to run offline simulation first to determine if your RL model meets production criteria. In this case, you may have a static dataset, similar to the MovieLens dataset but potentially larger, and you can construct a custom simulation environment to use in place of the MovieLens one. In the custom environment, you may decide how to formulate observations and rewards, such as in terms of how to represent users with user vectors and what those vectors look like, perhaps via an embedding layer in a neural network. You may apply the rest of the steps and code in this demo just as you did for MovieLens, and then evaluate your model. After offline simulation, you may proceed to the next-steps of launching your model, such as A/B testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Real-World System\n",
        "\n",
        "When you deploy the steps in this demo in production, you would replace the MovieLens simulation environment with a real-world system or communication mechanism that binds to the real world. In training, you pull user vectors/observations and ratings/rewards from the real-world environment. Now, the individual entries in the user vectors may have actual meanings such as user age. Again, you may decide how to formulate observations and rewards. In prediction, the observations packaged in prediction requests are again the same kind of user vectors as in training, with the same real-world meanings; you would generate them with the same mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal for prediction would again be to determine what movie items to recommend for a particular user. You would represent said user with a user vector using the mechanism you determined, send that vector in as the observation, and obtain the recommended movie item in the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance and scalability analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use TensorBoard Profiler, as well as other TensorBoard features, to analyze training performance and find solutions to speed up and/or better scale your application."
