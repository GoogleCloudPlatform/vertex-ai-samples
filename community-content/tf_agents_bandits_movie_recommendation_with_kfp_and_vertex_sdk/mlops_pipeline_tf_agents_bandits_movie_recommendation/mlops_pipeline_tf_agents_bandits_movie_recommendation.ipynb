        "This demo showcases the use of [TF-Agents](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents), [Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/overview/pipelines-overview/) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), particularly [Vertex Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines), in building an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline of a movie recommendation system. The demo is intended for developers who want to create RL applications using TensorFlow, TF-Agents and Vertex AI services, and those who want to build end-to-end production pipelines using KFP and Vertex Pipelines. It is recommended for developers to have familiarity with RL and the contextual bandits formulation, and the TF-Agents interface.\n",

The method also automatically creates a Cloud Function that acts as an intermediary between the Scheduler and Pipelines.
