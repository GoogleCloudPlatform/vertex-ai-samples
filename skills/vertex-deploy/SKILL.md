# Vertex AI Model Garden Deploy Skill

This skill provides instructions for deploying Open Models from Vertex AI Model
Garden to endpoints, and subsequently undeploying them to clean up resources.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have the correct project and region set. The
commands below use placeholder variables `PROJECT_ID` and `LOCATION_ID`.

Ensure you are authenticated: `bash gcloud auth login gcloud auth
application-default login gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID`

## 2. Discovering Deployable Models

You can list models available in Model Garden and check if they can be
self-deployed.

```bash
gcloud ai model-garden models list
```

To see what machine types and accelerators are supported for a specific model
(e.g., `google/gemma3@gemma-3-27b-it`):

```bash
gcloud ai model-garden models list-deployment-config \
    --model="google/gemma3@gemma-3-27b-it"
```

> [!NOTE] Some models, especially Hugging Face models, might require a Hugging
> Face Access Token for deployment.

> [!TIP] **Model Recommendation Instructions:** If a user asks to deploy a model
> but **does not specify which one**, you should recommend a model based on
> their use case (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B for general purpose or Gemma 3 for
> lightweight tasks). * You **MUST** ensure you are recommending the **latest
> version** or **popular version** of the suggested model family. * You **MUST**
> verify the model is currently deployable using `gcloud ai model-garden models
> list` before suggesting it to the user.

## 3. Deploying a Model

> [!WARNING] Deploying models, especially large ones, consumes significant
> compute resources and incurs costs. 1. You **MUST** refer to
> [Vertex AI prediction pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#prediction-and-explanation)
> to calculate a rough cost estimation based on the requested `--machine-type`
> and `--accelerator-type` (and count). 2. You **MUST** present this cost
> estimation to the user and warn them that this is the **list price**, which
> may differ from their actual bill due to potential discounts or reservations.
> 3. You **MUST ALWAYS** request explicit confirmation from the user agreeing to
> the estimated cost before executing any `deploy` command.

To deploy a model, use the `deploy` command. It is highly recommended to use the
`--asynchronous` flag for long-running deployments, and then poll the status if
necessary.

### Example: Deploying Gemma 3

Here is a typical bash script to deploy a model. You can run this block
directly.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example script to deploy a model from Model Garden

PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
LOCATION_ID="us-central1" # Recommended default region
MODEL_ID="google/gemma3@gemma-3-27b-it" # Replace with your chosen model ID

echo "Deploying model $MODEL_ID to project $PROJECT_ID in $LOCATION_ID..."

# Model Garden can automatically select the required hardware based on the list-deployment-config if hardware params are omitted.
# Below is a comprehensive command with all supported parameters:
gcloud ai model-garden models deploy \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID \
    --region=$LOCATION_ID \
    --model=$MODEL_ID \
    --machine-type="g2-standard-48" \
    --accelerator-type="NVIDIA_L4" \
    --accelerator-count=4 \
    --endpoint-display-name="my-gemma-deployment" \
    --hugging-face-access-token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN" \
    --reservation-affinity="reservation-affinity-type=specific-reservation,key=compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name,values=my-reservation" \
    --asynchronous

echo "Deployment initiated asynchronously."
echo "Check the Google Cloud Console (Vertex AI -> Online Prediction) for status."
```

### Example: Deploying Custom Weights

To deploy a model using custom weights, you can use the exact same `deploy`
command. Instead of providing the model garden model ID, provide the Google
Cloud Storage (GCS) URI to your custom weights folder in the `--model` flag.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example script to deploy a model with custom weights from a GCS bucket

PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
LOCATION_ID="us-central1"
# Replace with the gs:// URI pointing to your custom weights
MODEL_GCS_URI="gs://your-bucket-name/path/to/custom-weights"

echo "Deploying custom model from $MODEL_GCS_URI to project $PROJECT_ID in $LOCATION_ID..."

gcloud ai model-garden models deploy \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID \
    --region=$LOCATION_ID \
    --model=$MODEL_GCS_URI \
    --machine-type="g2-standard-12" \
    --accelerator-type="NVIDIA_L4" \
    --endpoint-display-name="my-custom-model" \
    --asynchronous

echo "Deployment initiated asynchronously."
```

## 4. Checking Deployment Status

When you deploy a model asynchronously using the `--asynchronous` flag, the
`deploy` command will return an operation ID. You can use this ID to check the
ongoing status of the deployment.

```bash
gcloud ai operations describe YOUR_OPERATION_ID \
    --region=$LOCATION_ID
```

> [!NOTE] As an agent, you can also offer to check the status of a deployment
> for the user if they provide an operation ID or if they just initiated the
> deployment with you.

Alternatively, you can list your endpoints to see if it shows up and check the
Cloud Console under the "Online prediction" tab.

```bash
gcloud ai endpoints list \
    --region=$LOCATION_ID
```

Note: Large models (like Llama 3.1 8B or Gemma 27B) may take 15-20 minutes to
fully deploy and start serving.

### Verifying Deployment

If the model is successfully deployed, verify by making a prediction call to
test. Because Model Garden models are often deployed to Dedicated Endpoints, you
shouldn't use `gcloud ai endpoints predict`. Instead, you must fetch the
endpoint's dedicated DNS name and send a `curl` request.

> [!TIP] Ask the user to try using their own prompt to see the results.
> Otherwise use the default.

Use the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
LOCATION_ID="us-central1"
ENDPOINT_ID="YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID"
PROMPT=${1:-"Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}

echo "Fetching dedicated Endpoint DNS..."
ENDPOINT_URL=$(gcloud ai endpoints describe $ENDPOINT_ID --project=$PROJECT_ID --region=$LOCATION_ID --format="value(dedicatedEndpointDns)")

if [ -z "$ENDPOINT_URL" ]; then
    echo "Error: Could not retrieve a dedicated endpoint URL. Verify your ENDPOINT_ID."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Sending prediction request to $ENDPOINT_URL..."
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://${ENDPOINT_URL}/v1beta1/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/locations/${LOCATION_ID}/endpoints/${ENDPOINT_ID}/chat/completions" \
  -d '{
    "model": "'"$ENDPOINT_ID"'",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "'"$PROMPT"'"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## 5. Undeploying and Cleaning Up

To stop incurring charges, you must undeploy the model from the endpoint. This
is a multi-step process if you don't already have the exact endpoint and
deployed model IDs.

### Example: Finding and Undeploying a Model

Here is a bash script demonstrating how to find the IDs and undeploy the model.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example script to undeploy a model

PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
LOCATION_ID="us-central1"
# The model ID used during deployment (without the provider prefix sometimes, or exactly as listed in describe)
# It's usually easier to find the specific ID via `gcloud ai models list`
# For this example, let's assume we know the exact Endpoint ID and Deployed Model ID.

# 1. Find the Endpoint ID
echo "Listing endpoints in $LOCATION_ID:"
gcloud ai endpoints list --project=$PROJECT_ID --region=$LOCATION_ID

# (Assuming you extracted ENDPOINT_ID from the above output)
# ENDPOINT_ID="your_endpoint_id"

# 2. Find the Deployed Model ID
echo "Listing models in $LOCATION_ID to find model description:"
gcloud ai models list --project=$PROJECT_ID --region=$LOCATION_ID

# (Assuming you found the specific MODEL_ID)
# MODEL_ID="your_model_id"
# gcloud ai models describe $MODEL_ID --project=$PROJECT_ID --region=$LOCATION_ID
# (Extract the deployedModelId from the output)
# DEPLOYED_MODEL_ID="your_deployed_model_id"

# 3. Undeploy
# Uncomment and replace the variables below to actually perform the undeployment
# echo "Undeploying model $DEPLOYED_MODEL_ID from endpoint $ENDPOINT_ID..."
# gcloud ai endpoints undeploy-model $ENDPOINT_ID \
#     --project=$PROJECT_ID \
#     --region=$LOCATION_ID \
#     --deployed-model-id=$DEPLOYED_MODEL_ID
#
# echo "Model undeployed."

# 4. Delete Endpoint
# echo "Deleting endpoint $ENDPOINT_ID..."
# gcloud ai endpoints delete $ENDPOINT_ID \
#     --project=$PROJECT_ID \
#     --region=$LOCATION_ID \
#     --quiet
# echo "Endpoint deleted."

# 5. Delete Model
# echo "Deleting model $MODEL_ID..."
# gcloud ai models delete $MODEL_ID \
#     --project=$PROJECT_ID \
#     --region=$LOCATION_ID \
#     --quiet
# echo "Model deleted."
```

> [!WARNING] Failing to undeploy a model will result in continuous charges for
> the allocated compute resources, even if you are not sending prediction
> requests. Always clean up after testing.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failure: Quota or Resource Exhausted

If your deployment fails (or stays in an error state) due to `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` or
`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors, the specific hardware requested (e.g., `NVIDIA_L4`
or `g2-standard-24`) is either not available in your chosen region or exceeds
your project's quota limits.

**Solution:** Look closely at the error message returned. It will often
recommend an alternative region or machine type that currently has availability.
**Ask the user for confirmation** to retry the deployment using the suggested
`--region` or `--machine-type` parameters.

> [!WARNING] If the alternative suggestions involve changing the machine type or
> accelerator, you **MUST** recalculate the estimated cost using
> [Vertex AI prediction pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#prediction-and-explanation),
> warn the user about list prices versus actual billing, and get their explicit
> confirmation for the new cost before retrying the deployment.
