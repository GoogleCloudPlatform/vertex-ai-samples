"""
 This script is used to update variables in the notebook via regex
 It requires variables to be defined in particular format

For example, if your variable was PROJECT_ID, use:

    PROJECT_ID = "[your_project_here]"

Single-quotes also work:

    PROJECT_ID = '[your_project_here]'

Variables in conditionals can also be replaced:

    PROJECT_ID == "[your_project_here]"
