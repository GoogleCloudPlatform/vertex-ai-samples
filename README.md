## Get started

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have a Google Cloud project. 

- If you don't have a Google Cloud project, you can learn and build on GCP for free using [Free Trail](https://cloud.google.com/free).
- Once you have a Google Cloud project, you can learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).
