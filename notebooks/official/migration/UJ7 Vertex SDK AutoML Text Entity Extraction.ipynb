        "test_item_1 = 'Molecular basis of hexosaminidase A deficiency and pseudodeficiency in the Berks County Pennsylvania Dutch.\\tFollowing the birth of two infants with Tay-Sachs disease ( TSD ) , a non-Jewish , Pennsylvania Dutch kindred was screened for TSD carriers using the biochemical assay . A high frequency of individuals who appeared to be TSD heterozygotes was detected ( Kelly et al . , 1975 ) . Clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit . We now report two mutant alleles in this Pennsylvania Dutch kindred , and one polymorphism . One allele , reported originally in a French TSD patient ( Akli et al . , 1991 ) , is a GT-- > AT transition at the donor splice-site of intron 9 . The second , a C-- > T transition at nucleotide 739 ( Arg247Trp ) , has been shown by Triggs-Raine et al . ( 1992 ) to be a clinically benign \" pseudodeficient \" allele associated with reduced enzyme activity against artificial substrate . Finally , a polymorphism [ G-- > A ( 759 ) ] , which leaves valine at codon 253 unchanged , is described'\n",
        "test_item_2 = \"Analysis of alkaptonuria (AKU) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the CCC sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase gene (HGO).\tWe recently showed that alkaptonuria ( AKU ) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) . Herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of HGO in seven new AKU pedigrees . These analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( INV4 + 31A-- > G and INV11 + 18A-- > G ) and six novel AKU mutations ( INV1-1G-- > A , W60G , Y62C , A122D , P230T , and D291E ) , which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in AKU . Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed ; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement , GGG , are preferentially mutated . These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides , which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs . Because the CCC sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion ( 34 . 5 % ) of all mutated bases that have been observed in HGO , we conclude that the CCC triplet is a mutational hot spot in HGO .\""

        "test_item = 'Molecular basis of hexosaminidase A deficiency and pseudodeficiency in the Berks County Pennsylvania Dutch.\\tFollowing the birth of two infants with Tay-Sachs disease ( TSD ) , a non-Jewish , Pennsylvania Dutch kindred was screened for TSD carriers using the biochemical assay . A high frequency of individuals who appeared to be TSD heterozygotes was detected ( Kelly et al . , 1975 ) . Clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit . We now report two mutant alleles in this Pennsylvania Dutch kindred , and one polymorphism . One allele , reported originally in a French TSD patient ( Akli et al . , 1991 ) , is a GT-- > AT transition at the donor splice-site of intron 9 . The second , a C-- > T transition at nucleotide 739 ( Arg247Trp ) , has been shown by Triggs-Raine et al . ( 1992 ) to be a clinically benign \" pseudodeficient \" allele associated with reduced enzyme activity against artificial substrate . Finally , a polymorphism [ G-- > A ( 759 ) ] , which leaves valine at codon 253 unchanged , is described'"
