* Prediction Service: Does an on-demand prediction for the entire set of instances (i.e., one or more data items) and returns the results in real-time.

* Batch Prediction Service: Does a queued (batch) prediction for the entire set of instances in the background and stores the results in a Cloud Storage bucket when ready.
