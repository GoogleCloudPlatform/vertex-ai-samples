# Timeseries Insights API Demonstration

The [Timeseries Insights](https://cloud.google.com/timeseries-insights) is and
API designed for gathering insights in real-time from your time series
datasets.

This example code demonstrates basic usage of the API for detecting anomalies
in near real-time from the [GDelt](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) tv news ngram
data.

The hourly output of detected spiking n-grams and count timeseries will be
stored in the GCP storage.
