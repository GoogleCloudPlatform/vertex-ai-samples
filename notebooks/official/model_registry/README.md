```
Learn how to use `Vertex AI Model Registry` with `BigQuery ML` and make batch predictions:

The steps performed include:

- Train a model with `BigQuery ML`
- Upload the model to `Vertex AI Model Registry` 
- Create a `Vertex AI Endpoint` resource
- Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource
- Make `prediction` requests to the model endpoint
- Run `batch prediction` job on the `Model` resource

```
