Learn how to use `Vertex AI Model Registry` with `BigQuery ML` and make batch predictions:

The steps performed include:

- Train a model with `BigQuery ML`
- Upload the model to `Vertex AI Model Registry` 
- Create a `Vertex AI Endpoint` resource
- Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource
- Make `prediction` requests to the model endpoint
- Run `batch prediction` job on the `Model` resource

```

Learn how to use `Vertex AI Model Registry` to create and register multiple versions of a model.

The steps performed include:

- Create and register a first version of a model to `Vertex AI Model Registry`.
- Create and register a second version of a model to `Vertex AI Model Registry`.
- Updating the model version which is the default (blessed).
- Deleting a model version.
- Retraining the next model version.
