        "The Chicago Taxi Trips dataset includes taxi trips from 2013 to the present, reported to the city of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number, census tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting process, not all trips are reported but the city believes that most are. This dataset is publicly available on BigQuery as a public dataset with the table ID `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` and also as a public dataset on Kaggle at [Chicago Taxi Trips](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-trips-bq).\n",

Apparently, this field is a summation of the `fare`,`tips`,`tolls` and `extras` fields and so because of their correlation with the target variable, they are being excluded for modeling. Due to the volume of the data, a subset of the dataset over the course of one week, 12-May-2018 to 18-May-2018 is being considered.
