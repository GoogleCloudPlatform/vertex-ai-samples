The executor can help you run a notebook file from start to end, with your choice of the environment, machine type, input parameters, and other characteristics. After setting up an execution, the notebook is executed as a job in Vertex AI custom training. Your jobs can be monitored from the Executor pane in the left sidebar.\n",

Apart from the custom container that replicates the existing kernel by default, pre-built environments like TensorFlow Enterprise, PyTorch, and others can also be selected to run the notebook. The required compute power can be specified by choosing from the list of machine types available, including GPUs.\n",
