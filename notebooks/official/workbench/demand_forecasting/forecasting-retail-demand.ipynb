    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores demand forecasting using a BigQuery public retail dataset. Being able to measure and forecast customer demand can help retailers better understand their customers, stock shelves with the right products, offer targeted promotions, and generally, better plan and manage their budgets. This notebook applies an ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) model from BigQuery ML on retail data. This notebook demonstrates how to train and evaluate a BigQuery ML model for demand forecasting datasets and extract actionable future insights.\n",

    "*Note: This notebook file was designed to run in a [Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/managed/create-instance) instance using the `Python (Local)` kernel. Some components of this notebook may not work in other notebook environments.*\n",

    "#### ARIMA Modeling with BigQuery ML \n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average'>ARIMA model</a> is designed to analyze historical data, spot patterns over time, and project them into the future--in other words, forecasting. The model is available inside BigQuery ML and enables users to create and execute machine learning models directly in BigQuery using SQL queries. Working with BigQuery ML is advantageous, as it already has access to the data, it can handle most of the modeling details automatically if desired, and will store both the model and any predictions also inside BigQuery.
