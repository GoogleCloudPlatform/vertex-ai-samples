        "Assume that the Citi Bike users move through the Manhattan's roads, which are the perfectly perpendicular streets, the trip distance can be calculated by applying the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).\n",
        "\n",
        "To Calulate the Manhattan distance, assume that you are in the **W 15th St and 9th Ave, where Google NYC is located,** and you want to go to **W 33rd St and 5th Ave, where the Empire State building is located**. In a full of city blocks, the fastest way you can get to the destination is to move east until you reached the 5th Avenue, and move north until you reached the W 33rd St. In this case, **W 16th St and 5th Ave** or **W 33rd St and 9th Ave** can be a hinge point. If we set the starting point as **S**, the ending point as **E**, and the hinge point as **H**, the formula of Manhattan distance is `distance(S, H) + distance(H, E)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in a real world, it requires more calculation to get the \"real\" Manhattan distance. First of all, unlike the Cartesian coordinate system. the actual distance in longitude varies with latitude. For example, 1 degree of longitude represents roughly 69 miles at equator, is the same as latitude, while it is about 49 miles at 45 degrees North or South. To calculate the exact distance in a real world using latitudes and longitudes, [Haversine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) is one of the good choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the streets in Manhattan are inclined at about 29 degrees to the True north, so you should rotate the point S and E by 29 degrees counter-clockwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the final formula should be `manhattan_distance = haversine_distance(S', H') + haversine_distance(H', E')` where `S'`, `H'`, `E'` are the rotated points."
