```
Learn how to use `Vertex AI Predictions` for rapid prototyping a model.

The steps performed include:

- Creating a BigQuery and Vertex AI training dataset.
- Training a BigQuery ML and AutoML model.
- Extracting evaluation metrics from the BigQueryML and AutoML models.
- Selecting the best trained model.
- Deploying the best trained model.
- Testing the deployed model infrastructure.
