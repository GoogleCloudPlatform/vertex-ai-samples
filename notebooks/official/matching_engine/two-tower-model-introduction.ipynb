These objects are encoded by a query and candidate encoder (the two \"towers\") respectively, which are trained on pairs of relevant items.

For simplicity, the data for this tutorial only includes the user id feature for users, and the movie id and movie title features for movies. In this example, the user is the query object and the movie is the candidate object, and each training example in the dataset contains a user and a movie they rated (we only include positive ratings in the dataset).
