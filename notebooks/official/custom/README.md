[Deploying Iris-detection model using FastAPI and Vertex AI custom container serving](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/custom/SDK_Custom_Container_Prediction.ipynb)

```
Learn how to create, deploy and serve a custom classification model on Vertex AI.

The steps performed include:

- Train a model that uses flower's measurements as input to predict the class of iris.
- Save the model and its serialized pre-processor.
- Build a FastAPI server to handle predictions and health checks.
- Build a custom container with model artifacts.
- Upload and deploy custom container to Vertex AI Endpoints.

[Training and deploying a sales forecasting model using FBProphet and Vertex AI](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/custom/SDK_FBProphet_Forecasting_Online.ipynb)

```
The objective of this notebook is to create, deploy and serve a custom forecasting model on Vertex AI.

The steps performed include:
- Train a model locally that forecasts sales for the given number of days.
- Train another model that uses both sales and weather data for sales prediction.
- Save both the models.
- Build a FastAPI server to handle the predictions for the chosen model.
- Build a custom container image of the serving application with the model artifacts.
- Upload the model to Vertex AI Model Registry.
- Deploy the model to a Vertex AI Endpoint.
- Send online prediction requests to the deployed model.
- Clean up the resources created in this session.
