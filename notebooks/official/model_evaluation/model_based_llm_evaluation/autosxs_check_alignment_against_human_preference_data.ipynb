They spent so much of their time and money making the graphics perfect that the game itself is a hollow shell of what could have been a JRPG. It was so expensive and time consuming that they couldn't even consider designing FFXV for this generation and had to push out FFXIII-2 because they spent too much money on those art assets to not use them again. This is the company that epitomizes the problems with AAA gaming's focus on having the best graphics all the time. They spent half of this generation making sure FFXIII was the prettiest game ever and forgot to actually develop a real game to go along with those visuals. All a new generation would mean for Squeenix is 8 years spent making FFXV have the best looking shoelaces any game has ever had only to have the game be released to rampant hate because we don't give two shits about the fucking shoelaces (like how Snow's hair didn't convince us that FFXIII was a quality product).\",\n",
        "    \"We bought a house! But the paint colors aren't great - lots of bright colors in what used to be kids' rooms and walls in need of retouching in the common areas. I'd like to get starting on the paint project right away and my family will be visiting in two weeks to help - so I'd like to develop a paint scheme to go off of. I get a little overwhelmed when contemplating the seemingly endless paint colors at Home Depot. I want neutral walls, but should I stick with one shade throughout or mix it up? Is beige blah, is cream too boring, and could anyone tell me what #%&! greige is? My couch is brown leather, the entertainment center, kitchen table, and bedroom furniture are a warm cherry, and the cabinetry is maple. Since we'll be buying furniture over time as funds allow, I think neutral walls that play well off other colors is my best bet. The house gets gorgeous light from western facing windows, but even still I don't want to go too dramatic or dark.\",\n",
        "    \"I'd like to talk about bows. Why? Because they sit in a very strange place in the end game right now. If you don't want to use a bow, more often than not you'll end up in two very frustrating scenarios. You're either being kited to death by a jump shotting stamina shot user, or you're sitting behind whatever cover you can waiting for nothing in particular because someone is taking potshots at you. Now you may say 'Take the damage reduction perk' or 'just use your own bow'. And you'd be right. That would solve the issue somewhat. Problem is, those are basically the ONLY way to deal with it. There's a lack of diversity. When things become mandatory in a competitive setting, there's a balance issue. So. I want to talk about solutions on how to give bows fair counterplay without breaking them. And Ill start by sharing my own ideas on the matted, starting with a few simple ideas like these. Make a non-fully charged bow shot travel VERY little distance. Make charging bows in mid-air impossible. Make players momentum/speed slow when charging and shortly after shooting so they are easier to catch. Raise the stamina cost of charging a bow shot. Make charging a bow shot slower. Bows should be like snipers. Not SMGs. Using a bow effectively should be about keeping your enemy at a distance and whittling them down. If you have someone rushing you down and you try to snipe at them before they get to you, there should be some cost to it. If it used a noticeable amount of stamina to fire, then you have to start weighing risk and reward. Is it worth putting yourself at a stamina disadvantage should you miss? How much time would you have to recover that lost stamina? What if they get to you before you can switch weapons and guard? They'd get a free hit. As it stands, using bows is really risk free, and I believe that should change. Also something to remember is that if you're comfortably set up without your opponent able to approach you, the stamina drain wouldn't do much aside from make you have to think about how youre firing. Do you unload arrows in a rapid volley, leaving your stamina low and risking being at a disadvantage if your opponent gets to you? Or do you space out your shots so you stay at max stamina, but fire less rapidly? I also feel the ending arena should be changed a bit to make approaching a little more viable, but I digress.\",\n",
        "    \"I’d been watching [James Marshal]( videos for the past couple of days and with the concepts swirling around in my mind, I decided to smile less at work. I work in a shop, selling alcohol, cigarettes, confectionery, soft drinks amongst other things. In an attempt to offer the customer a pleasant experience, you smile, say please, say thank you and all other polite things. I tried to do the opposite. Not smiling, not saying thank you, not nodding, not saying anything for a few moments. It was difficult to do, because much of my behaviour is habitual through years of working in a retail environment. Some of my thoughts were “It’s going to be awkward; they won’t be happy about it; I’m going to feel uncomfortable; It’s scary.” It was awkward. It was scary. It was uncomfortable. But less than I’d imagined. And I don’t think anyone cared. Some of the regulars might have noticed something different, but nobody said anything. In fact, the hardest part was not nodding or saying thank you or cheers. Why smile less? Why stop saying thank you? In hindsight what I was doing was playing around with the concept of Pressure and Release. When people are nervous, be it talking to an attractive lady or whatever, there is the compulsion to say something to release the pressure. Sexual tension can’t build without any pressure. James Marshall loves to sit in that tension. When you watch him speak he has an enormous presence on stage, particular when he isn’t saying anything. Improving Pressure and Release will increase sexual tension will improve your results with women. However, in the shop, I was using it because it directly ties in with my social anxiety. When I’m compulsively smiling and talking it’s because I’m feeling uncomfortable and I’m not okay with pauses and silences of two seconds or more. Smiling less, delaying my thank yous, strong eye contact with no talking were all ways of exploring the silence, the tension and the pressure. James Marshall also encourages to remove the judgement and labels from feelings and sensations. Social anxiety, approach anxiety, fear, embarrassment, shame, and so on are shorn of their names. Instead, Marshall encourages you to focus on the physical sensations and describe those without judgement. I can’t remember what the feeling was, but the other day I noticed there was tightness in the abdomen, the chest, the throat and the face. And with this feeling, everything was happening in the front of my body with nothing going on in the back. The Smiling Less experiment happened for the whole day. It felt quite weird at first, like I wasn’t being myself. But I remembered something Marshall said: “What possible new behaviours could you adopt and could be you?” This quote in turn reminded me of the [Feldenkrais Method]( which is all about doing and learning new movements to change what is habitual and usually painful to your body. What Marshall was saying was like the Feldenkrais Method but instead of movement it was social interaction. As the day wore on, I became a bit more like my old self. This happened because it was tiring to adopt new behaviours for a whole day and I also think it happened because my subconscious was calibrating on how to fit this with the rest of my personality. Another way of looking at this experiment is that I was [regulating my emotional compulsions.]( Instead of saying or doing the first habitual thing that came to mind, I paused or did something else. This goes against some ideas like going with your gut or the popular idea of improvisation where you blurt and do things with no filter. Impro is like that i.e. responding to your impulse or desire to do something, but oftentimes in bad improv it’s a result of adrenalin and nerves and a need to make things comfortable and safe. In impro, we channel what the audience wants most. And almost always it’s the uncomfortable and dangerous option. As my facilitator has said, “When you’re in the shit, stay in the shit.” By smiling less, I was putting myself in the shit. At least what I thought was the shit. It wasn’t easy, but it was easy enough for it to be surmountable. I hoping to take some of what I learned at the shop to the open mic I’ll be hosting tomorrow. Breathe, pause and smile less.\",\n",

Social situations tire me out quicker. Instead of preferring and dominating group conversations I find myself often in 1-on-1 conversations. I talk less and listen more. I can't pin this down to the course definitely because a number of other factors in my life have changed. (After the course I went traveling and got sick of 3-day friends. I graduated university before the course. I've been teaching myself conversational skills, which often have an emphasis on letting other person talk. I've also had a lot of experiences in my life recently of making friends and then them or myself moving to different cities, and I've recently moved cities. It could just be me getting older (23M).) But I had a distinct experience following the course which makes me think it's highly related - on the night of the day we broke silence, everyone was talking loudly in a large group. The old me would have loved this situation and probably been one of the loudest in the group. But instead of joining the group I went for a walk into night by myself. When I did speak to people, I gravitated towards the quieter people in the course. This was the completely out of character for me, and it was the first time I felt like I did that day. I'm not necessarily concerned about this change, in fact it might make me more suited for my job (software engineer). But I'm still trying to make sense it - it's a pretty large change in my personality. If anyone has had a similar experience or can offer an explanation, I'd appreciate it.\",\n",

To me I think the change is good, they just need to make it clear that it converts previous league tabs into the new tabs (for the permeant leagues) I don't think the whole previous league tab thing was meant to be a way of artificially increasing your stash space, but some people got used to it and should get used to the new change, most of us really don't need a whole bunch of unique item tabs from previous leagues that match all other previous leagues.\",\n",
