[Online prediction with BigQuery ML](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/bigquery_ml/bqml-online-prediction.ipynb)

Learn how to train and deploy a churn prediction model for real-time inference, with the data in BigQuery and model trained using BigQuery ML, registered to Vertex AI Model Registry, and deployed to an endpoint on Vertex AI for online predictions.

The steps performed include:

- Using Python & SQL to query the public data in BigQuery
- Preparing the data for modeling
- Training a classification model using BigQuery ML and registering it to Vertex AI Model Registry
- Inspecting the model on Vertex AI Model Registry
- Deploying the model to an endpoint on Vertex AI
- Making sample online predictions to the model endpoint
