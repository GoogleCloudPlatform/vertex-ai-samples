```
In this tutorial, you fetch the required data from a public BigQuery dataset and prepare it for training.

The steps performed include:

- Query and fetch the data from the public BigQuery dataset.
- Prepare the data for training.
- Train a churn classification model using BigQuery ML.
- Save the trained model to Vertex AI Model Registry.
- Deploy the model to a Vertex AI Endpoint.
- Make online prediction requests to the endpoint.

```

Learn how to use `BigQueryML` for training with `Vertex AI`.

The steps performed include:

- Create a local BigQuery table in your project
- Train a BigQuery ML model
- Evaluate the BigQuery ML model
- Export the BigQuery ML model as a cloud model
- Upload the exported model as a `Vertex AI Model` resource
- Hyperparameter tune a BigQuery ML model with `Vertex AI Vizier`
- Automatically register a BigQuery ML model to `Vertex AI Model Registry`
