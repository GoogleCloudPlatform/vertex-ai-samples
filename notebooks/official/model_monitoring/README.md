[Vertex AI Batch Prediction with Model Monitoring](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/model_monitoring/batch_prediction_model_monitoring.ipynb)

```
Learn to use the `Vertex AI Model Monitoring` service to detect drift and anomalies in batch prediction.

The steps performed include:

- Upload a pre-trained model as a Vertex AI Model resource.
- Generate batch prediction requests.
- Interpret the statistics, visualizations, other data reported by the model monitoring feature.

```
Learn to use the `Vertex AI Model Monitoring` service to detect drift and anomalies in prediction requests from a deployed `Vertex AI Model` resource.

The steps performed include:

- Upload a pre-trained model as a `Vertex AI Model` resource.
- Create an `Vertex AI Endpoint` resource.
- Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource.
- Configure the `Endpoint` resource for model monitoring.
- Initialize the baseline distribution for model monitoring.
- Generate synthetic prediction requests.
- Understand how to interpret the statistics, visualizations, other data reported by the model monitoring feature.
