        "\n",
        "Modern applications rely on a well established set of capabilities to monitor the health of their services. Examples include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* software versioning\n",
        "* rigorous deployment processes\n",
        "* event logging\n",
        "* alerting/notication of situations requiring intervention\n",
        "* on-demand and automated diagnostic tracing\n",
        "* automated performance and functional testing\n",
        "\n",
        "You should be able to manage your ML services with the same degree of power and flexibility with which you can manage your applications. That's what MLOps is all about - managing ML services with the best practices Google and the broader computing industry have learned from generations of experience deploying well engineered, reliable, and scalable services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model monitoring is only one piece of the ML Ops puzzle - it helps answer the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* How well do recent service requests match the training data used to build your model? This is called **training-serving skew**.\n",
        "* How significantly are service requests evolving over time? This is called **drift detection**.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Vertex Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview) adds another facet to model monitoring, called feature attribution monitoring. Explainable AI enables you to understand the relative contribution of each feature to a resulting prediction. In essence, it assesses the magnitude of each feature's influence.\n",
        "\n",
        "If production traffic differs from  training data, or varies substantially over time, **either in terms of model predictions or feature attributions**, that's likely to impact the quality of the answers your model produces. When that happens, you'd like to be alerted automatically and responsively, so that **you can anticipate problems before they affect your customer experiences or your revenue streams**.\n",
