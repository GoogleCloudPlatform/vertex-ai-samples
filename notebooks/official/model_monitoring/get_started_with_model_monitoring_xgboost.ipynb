You can monitor for skewness and drift detection of the features in the inbound prediction requests or the feature attributions (Explainable AI) in the outbound prediction response. In other words, you monitor the distribution of the attributions that quantify feature contributions to the output (predictions).\n",

        "4. Upload schema or use automatic generation of the *input schema* for parsing.\n",
        "5. For feature skewness detection, upload the training data. This enables automatic generation of the feature distributions.\n",

For custom tabular models, the service attempts to automatically derive the input schema from the first 1000 prediction requests. Alternatively, one can upload the input schema.\n",
