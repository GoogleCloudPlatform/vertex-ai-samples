## Setup your environment
Duration: 10:00

Youâ€™ll need a Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled to run this codelab. To create a project, follow the [instructions here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects?utm_source=codelabs&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=CDR_sar_aiml_vertexio_&utm_content=-).

### Step 1: Enable the Vertex AI API

Navigate to the [Vertex AI section of your Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/platform?utm_source=codelabs&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=CDR_sar_aiml_vertexio_&utm_content=-) and click **Enable Vertex AI API**.


### Step 2: Open a Cloud Shell Session

Click the "Activate Cloud Shell" button in the upper right corner of the Cloud Console. This will take a minute or so to provision your cloud shell, which is a Linux command line interpreter running on an auto-provisioned virtual machine. This is where you will enter all the commands prescibed in subsequent steps. 

**In subsequent steps in this codelab, wherever you see Python code, you'll want to save that code in a file, using either a text editor or the Cloud Editor, and run the code by typing *python3 file.py* in the Cloud Shell window.**
