[Compare pipeline runs with Vertex AI Experiments](official/experiments/comparing_pipeline_runs.ipynb)

Learn how to use `Vertex AI Experiments` to log a pipeline job and compare different pipeline jobs.



[Track parameters and metrics for locally trained models](official/experiments/comparing_local_trained_models.ipynb)

Learn how to use Vertex AI Experiments to compare and evaluate model experiments.

The steps performed include:

- log the model parameters
- log the loss and metrics on every epoch to TensorBoard
- log the evaluation metrics
