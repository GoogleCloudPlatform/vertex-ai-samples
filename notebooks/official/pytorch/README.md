[Training, tuning and deploying a PyTorch text sentiment classification model on Vertex AI](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/pytorch/pytorch-text-sentiment-classification-custom-train-deploy.ipynb)

```
Learn to build, train, tune and deploy a PyTorch model on [Vertex AI](https://cloud.

The steps performed include:

- Create training package for the text classification model.
- Train the model with custom training on Vertex AI.
- Check the created model artifacts.
- Create a custom container for predictions.
- Deploy the trained model to a Vertex AI Endpoint using the custom container for predictions.
- Send online prediction requests to the deployed model and validate.
- Clean up the resources created in this notebook.
