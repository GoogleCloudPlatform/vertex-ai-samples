        "Deploying a PyTorch [model on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/getting-predictions) requires you to use a custom container that serves online predictions on a Vertex AI Endpoint. You deploy a container running [PyTorch's TorchServe](https://pytorch.org/serve/) tool in order to serve predictions from the fine-tuned transformer model for a sentiment analysis task. Then, you can then use Vertex AI's online prediction service to classify the sentiment of input texts. \n",

        "### Deploying a model on Vertex AI using a custom container\n",
        "\n",
        "To use a custom container to serve predictions from a PyTorch model, you must provide Vertex AI with a Docker container image that runs an HTTP server application, such as TorchServe in this case. Learn more about the [prediction container requirements on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements).\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, the following steps are needed to deploy a PyTorch model on Vertex AI:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Package the trained model artifacts including [default](https://pytorch.org/serve/#default-handlers) or [custom](https://pytorch.org/serve/custom_service.html) handlers by creating an archive file using [Torch model archiver](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/model-archiver).\n",
        "2. Build a [custom container](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements) compatible with Vertex AI to serve the model using TorchServe.\n",
        "3. Upload the model with the custom container image to serve predictions as a Vertex AI model resource.\n",

        "#### Create a custom model handler to handle prediction requests\n",

Once the model generates predictions, some post-processing has to be performed on the generated output to label it into the underlying classes and serve their probabilities (or confidence scores). \n",
        "\n",
        "To include the steps like pre-processing and post-processing, you create a custom handler script that is packaged with the model artifacts. Later, TorchServe executes the script when deployed. \n",
        "\n",
        "Custom handler script does the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pre-process input text before sending it to the model for inference\n",
