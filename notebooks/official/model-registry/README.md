[Deploy BiqQuery ML Model on Vertex AI Model Registry and make predictions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/model-registry/bqml-vertexai-model-registry.ipynb)

Learn how to use `Vertex AI Model Registry` with `BigQuery ML` and make batch predictions:

The steps performed include:

- Train a model with `BigQuery ML`
- Upload the model to `Vertex AI Model Registry` 
- Create a `Vertex AI Endpoint` resource
- Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource
- Make `prediction` requests to the model endpoint
- Run `batch prediction` job on the `Model` resource
