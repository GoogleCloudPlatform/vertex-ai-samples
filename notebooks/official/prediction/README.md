[Custom model batch prediction with feature filtering](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/prediction/custom_batch_prediction_feature_filter.ipynb)

```
Learn how to create a custom-trained model from a Python script in a Docker container using the Vertex AI SDK for Python, and then run a batch prediction job by including or excluding a list of features.

The steps performed include:

- Create a Vertex AI custom `TrainingPipeline` for training a model.
- Train a TensorFlow model.
- Send batch prediction job.

```
