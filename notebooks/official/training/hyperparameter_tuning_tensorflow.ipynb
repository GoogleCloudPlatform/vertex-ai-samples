    "The values you select for your model’s hyperparameters can make all the difference. If you’re only trying to tune a handful of hyperparameters, you might be able to run experiments manually. But when you start juggling hyperparameters for your model’s architecture, the optimizer, and finding the best batch size and learning rate, automating these experiments at scale quickly becomes a necessity. \n",

    "Vertex AI Training includes a hyperparameter tuning service. A Vertex AI Hyperparameter tuning job will run multiple trials of your training code. On each trial, it will use different values for your chosen hyperparameters, set within limits you specify. By default, the service uses Bayesian optimization to search the space of possible hyperparameter values. This means that information from prior experiments is used to select the next set of values, making the search more efficient. "

More trials generally leads to better results, but there will be a point of diminishing returns, after which additional trials have little or no effect on the metric you're trying to optimize. It is a best practice to start with a smaller number of trials and get a sense of how impactful your chosen hyperparameters are before scaling up.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **parallel_trial_count**: If you use parallel trials, the service provisions multiple training processing clusters. Increasing the number of parallel trials reduces the amount of time the hyperparameter tuning job takes to run; however, it can reduce the effectiveness of the job overall. This is because the default tuning strategy uses results of previous trials to inform the assignment of values in subsequent trials.\n",

    "* **search_algorithm**: You can set the search algorithm to grid, random, or default (None). If you do not specify an algorithm, as shown in this example, the default option applies Bayesian optimization to search the space of possible hyperparameter values and is the recommended algorithm.
