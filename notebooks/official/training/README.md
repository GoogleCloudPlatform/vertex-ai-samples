Learn how to create a distributed PyTorch training job using Vertex AI SDK for Python and custom containers.

The steps performed include:

- Setting up your GCP project : Setting up the PROJECT_ID, REGION & SERVICE_ACCOUNT
- Creating a cloud storage bucket
- Building Custom Container using Artifact Registry and Docker
- Create a Vertex AI tensorboard instance to store your Vertex AI experiment
- Run a Vertex AI SDK CustomContainerTrainingJob
