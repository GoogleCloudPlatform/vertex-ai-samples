[Track artifacts and metrics across Vertex AI Pipelines runs using Vertex ML Metadata](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/ml_metadata/vertex-pipelines-ml-metadata.ipynb)

```
Learn how to track artifacts and metrics with `Vertex ML Metadata` in `Vertex AI Pipeline` runs.

The steps performed include:

* Use the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to build an ML pipeline that runs on Vertex AI
* The pipeline will create a dataset, train a scikit-learn model, and deploy the model to an endpoint
* Write custom pipeline components that generate artifacts and metadata
* Compare Vertex Pipelines runs, both in the Cloud console and programmatically
* Trace the lineage for pipeline-generated artifacts
* Query your pipeline run metadata
