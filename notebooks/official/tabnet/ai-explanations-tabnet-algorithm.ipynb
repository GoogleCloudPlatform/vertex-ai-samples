TabNet is an interpretable deep learning architecture for tabular (structured) data, the most common data type among enterprises. TabNet combines the best of two worlds: it is explainable, like simpler tree-based models, and can achieve the high accuracy of complex black-box models and ensembles, meaning it is precise without obscuring how the model works. This makes TabNet well-suited for a wide range of tabular data tasks where model explainability is just as important as accuracy.\n",
