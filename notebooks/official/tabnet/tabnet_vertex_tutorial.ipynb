        "TabNet combines the best of two worlds: it is explainable (similar to simpler tree-based models) while benefiting from high performance (similar to deep neural networks). This makes it great for retailers, finance and insurance industry applications such as predicting credit scores, fraud detection and forecasting. \n",
        "\n",
        "TabNet uses a machine learning technique called sequential attention to select which model features to reason from at each step in the model. This mechanism makes it possible to explain how the model arrives at its predictions and helps it learn more accurate models. Thanks to this design, TabNet not only outperforms other neural networks and decision trees but also provides interpretable feature attributions. Releasing TabNet as a First Party Trainer in Vertex AI means you'll be able to easily take advantage of TabNet's architecture and explainability and use it to train models on your own data. "
