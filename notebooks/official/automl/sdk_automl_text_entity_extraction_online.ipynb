A high frequency of individuals who appeared to be TSD heterozygotes was detected ( Kelly et al . , 1975 ) . Clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit . We now report two mutant alleles in this Pennsylvania Dutch kindred , and one polymorphism . One allele , reported originally in a French TSD patient ( Akli et al . , 1991 ) , is a GT-- > AT transition at the donor splice-site of intron 9 . The second , a C-- > T transition at nucleotide 739 ( Arg247Trp ) , has been shown by Triggs-Raine et al .
