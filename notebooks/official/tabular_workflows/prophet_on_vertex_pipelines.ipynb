        "In this tutorial, you take on the role of a store planner who must determine how much inventory they need to order for each of their products and stores for November 2019. You accomplish this by fitting a Prophet model to your historical sales data using Vertex AI Tabular Workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prophet is a forecasting model maintained by Meta. It can handle both univariate and multivariate time series, as long as covariates are available when making a forecast. See the Prophet [paper](https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/) for algorithm details and the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for more information about the library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like [BigQuery ML ARIMA_PLUS](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series), Prophet attempts to decompose each time series into trends, seasons, and holidays, producing a forecast using the aggregation of these models' predictions. One of many differences, however, is that BQML ARIMA+ uses ARIMA to model the trend component, while Prophet attempts to fit a curve using a piecewise logistic or linear model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Google Cloud offers a pipeline for Prophet model training and another for Prophet batch prediction. Both pipelines are instances of [Vertex AI Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction) from [Google Cloud Pipeline Components](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/components-introduction) (GCPC).\n",
        "\n",
        "The model training pipeline offers support for multiple time series. Because each Prophet model is designed for a single time series, the pipeline uses a [Vertex AI Custom Training Job](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/create-custom-job) and [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) to train multiple Prophet models in parallel. The model training pipeline performs hyperparameter tuning using [grid search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Grid_search) and Prophet's built-in backtesting logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Integration of Prophet with Vertex AI means that you can:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Use Vertex AI [data splitting](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/data-splits#forecasting) and [windowing strategies](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/bp-tabular#context-window).\n",
        "  * Read data from either BigQuery tables or CSVs stored in Cloud Storage. Vertex AI expects each row to have the same format as for [Vertex AI Forecasting](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/tabular-data/forecasting/prepare-data).\n",
