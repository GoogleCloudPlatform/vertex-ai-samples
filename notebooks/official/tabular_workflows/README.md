[Train a Prophet Model using Vertex AI Tabular Workflows](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/tabular_workflows/prophet_on_vertex_pipelines.ipynb)

```
Learn how to create several Prophet models using a training Vertex AI Pipeline from Google Cloud Pipeline Components , and then do a batch prediction using the corresponding prediction pipeline.

The steps performed are:

1. Train the Prophet models.
1. View the evaluation metrics.
1. Make a batch prediction with the Prophet models.

[TabNet Pipeline](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/tabular_workflows/tabnet_on_vertex_pipelines.ipynb)

```
Learn how to create two classification models using Vertex AI TabNet Tabular Workflows.

The steps performed include:

- Create a TabNet CustomJob. This is the best option if you know which hyperparameters to use for training.
- Create a TabNet HyperparameterTuningJob. This allows you to get the best set of hyperparameters for your dataset.
