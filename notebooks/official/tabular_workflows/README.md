[TabNet Pipeline](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/official/tabular_workflows/tabnet_on_vertex_pipelines.ipynb)

Learn how to create two classification models using Vertex AI TabNet Tabular Workflows.

The steps performed include:

- Create a TabNet CustomJob. This is the best option if you know which hyperparameters to use for training.
- Create a TabNet HyperparameterTuningJob. This allows you to get the best set of hyperparameters for your dataset.
