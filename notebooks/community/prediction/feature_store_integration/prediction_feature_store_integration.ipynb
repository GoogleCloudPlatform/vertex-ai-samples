    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to deploy and serve models on Vertex AI with Feature Store integration. This integration enables feature values to be fetched directly from Feature Store during a `predict` request, instead of having to specify feature values explicitly in the predict request.\n",

They are not intended for production use or covered by any SLA, support obligation, or deprecation policy and might be subject to backward-incompatible changes. They also may not be at the same reliability standards as a GA product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of the product for model deployment and serving is free during the Experimental release period: you will still incur charges for other GCP products usage, such as Feature store, storage, etc.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to this, when using Vertex AI Feature Store to store and fetch features for prediction, users had to first call Feature Store to fetch the features and then send those features to Vertex AI Prediction Service in a prediction request. Users frequently also performed feature transformations before or after sending the prediction instance to the prediction container. This led to a lot of orchestration on the user's end. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier for our users to use Feature Store and Prediction service together, we are offering a built-in integration between Feature Store and Prediction service. Users can now upload a config when they upload their model to the model registry. This config has information on what features the model takes, where are those feature stored in Vertex AI Feature Store and how the prediction request to the deployed models should be built. On the prediction path, users just give the IDs of the entities stored in the Feature Store, or any features they want to override. Vertex AI will take care of reading all the features, constructing and executing the prediction request and returning the final prediction response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should I care about this integration?**\n",
    "- Make predictions with a single call to online prediction service, instead of calling two separate services (one or more calls to feature store and one call to Prediction service)\n",
    "- Less code to be written and maintained by users, as they don't have to convert Feature Store's response to the format that the deployed model accepts.\n",
    "- Clients that send prediction requests to the deployed models do not have to worry about the features that a model accepts. As a result, data science teams building the models can continue to experiment without requiring every client to change their code every time a feature is added/deleted/modified. Therefore, it leads to faster iterations in organizations.\n",
    "- Model-Feature lineage can be easily and explicitly tracked.\n"

    "The model used in this notebook is based on [this blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/churn-prediction-game-developers-using-google-analytics-4-ga4-and-bigquery-ml). The model predicts the probability of a user churning. The [raw data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=firebase-public-project&d=analytics_153293282&t=events_20181003&page=table&_ga=2.214026135.-1049105954.1678419790) contains the following categories of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- identity - unique player identity numbers.\n",
    "- demographic features - information about the player, such as the geographic region in which a player is located.\n",
    "- behavioral features - counts of the number of times a player has triggered certain game events, such as reaching a new level.\n",
    "- churn propensity - this is the label or target feature, it provides an estimated probability that this player will churn, i.e. stop being an active player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blog article referenced above explains how to use BigQuery to store the raw data, pre-process the data for machine learning, and train the corresponding model.
