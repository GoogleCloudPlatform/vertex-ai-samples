        "- *allow_precompilation* - turns on model pre-compilation for better performance. Note that model precompilation happens when the first request with the new batch size arrives, and the response for that request is sent after precompilation is complete. To mitigate this, specify a warmup file (see the section earlier in this colab). Model precompilation works for different kinds of models, and in most cases has a positive effect on performance. However, we recommend that you try it out for your model before you enable it in production.\n",

In some cases this makes the model run significantly faster at the cost of very minimal loss to model prediction power.
