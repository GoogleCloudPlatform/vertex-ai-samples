    "Next, its time to build a custom serving container for the trained model and the data preprocessor. As for data preprocessing, we could fuse the data preprocessor to the model by using the AutoGraph compiler (e.g., @tf.function decorator) to conver the Python code to a static graph. There are a couple of limitations to this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Not all Python operations can be converted to a graph operation.\n",
    "    - Only static graph operations are supported.\n",
    "    \n",
