The HTTP server returns the output as the HTTP response content.\n",

Since this deployed model expects input data as raw (uncompressed) bytes, you need to ensure that the base 64 encoded data gets converted back to raw bytes, and then preprocessed to match the model input requirements, before it is passed as input to the deployed model.\n",
