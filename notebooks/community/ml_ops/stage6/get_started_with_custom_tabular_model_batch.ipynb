    "## Introduction to Batch Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch prediction provides the ability to do offline batch processing of large amounts of prediction requests. Resources are only provisioned during the batch process and then deprovisioned when the batch request is completed. The results are stored in Cloud Storage, in contrast to online prediction where the results are returned as a HTTP response packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input format for your batch job is dependent on the format supported by your model server. Foremost, the web server in your model server must support a JSONL format, which the web server will convert to a format support either directly by the model input intertace or a serving function interface. For batch prediction, this JSONL format is referred to as the `pivot` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input format for batch prediction jobs\n",

    "- BigQuery table\n",
