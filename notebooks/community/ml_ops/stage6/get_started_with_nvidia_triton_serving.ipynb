        "\n",
        "[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (Triton)](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) provides an inference solution optimized for both CPUs and GPUs. Triton can run multiple models from the same or different frameworks concurrently on a single GPU or CPU. In a multi-GPU server, it automatically creates an instance of each model on each GPU to increase utilization without extra coding. It supports real-time inferencing, batch inferencing to maximize GPU/CPU utilization, and streaming inference with built-in support for audio streaming input. It also supports model ensembles for use cases that require multiple models to perform end-to-end inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following figure shows the Triton's high-level architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Triton high level architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triton-inference-server/server/main/docs/images/arch.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "- The model repository is a file-system based repository of the models that Triton will make available for inference.\n",
        "- Inference requests arrive at the server via either HTTP/REST or gRPC and are then routed to the appropriate per-model scheduler.\n",
        "- Triton implements multiple scheduling and batching algorithms that can be configured on a model-by-model basis.\n",
        "- The backend performs inference using the inputs provided in the batched requests to produce the requested outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Triton provides readiness and liveness health endpoints, as well as utilization, throughput, and latency metrics, which enable the integration of Triton into deployment environments, such as Vertex AI Prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Refer to [Triton architecture](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) for more detailed information.\n",

        "## Triton on Vertex AI Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Triton inference server runs inside a container published by NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) - [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server Image](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver). NVIDIA and GCP Vertex AI team collaborated and added packages and configurations to align Triton with Vertex AI [requirements for custom serving container images](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements).\n",
        "\n",
        "The model to be served by Triton should be registered with Vertex AI as a `Model` resource. The `Model`'s metadata refer to a location of the ensemble artifacts in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and the custom serving container including configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Triton loads the models and exposes inference, health, and model management REST endpoints using [standard inference protocols](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/tree/master/docs/predict-api/v2). While deploying to Vertex AI, Triton recognizes Vertex AI environment and adopts Vertex AI Prediction protocol for [health checks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#health) and predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To invoke the model through the Vertex AI Prediction endpoint, format prediction request using a [standard Inference Request JSON Object](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/docs/predict-api/v2/required_api.md#inference) or a [Inference Request JSON Object with a binary extension](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/protocol/extension_binary_data.md) and submit a request to Vertex AI Prediction [REST rawPredict endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.endpoints/rawPredict). You need to use the `rawPredict` rather than `predict` endpoint because inference request formats used by Triton are not compatible with the Vertex AI Prediction [standard input format](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/online-predictions-custom-models#formatting-prediction-input).\n",
