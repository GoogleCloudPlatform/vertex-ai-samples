You can monitor for skew and drift detection of the features in the inbound prediction requests or skew and drift detection of the feature attributions (Explainable AI) in the outbound prediction response -- that is, the distribution of the attributions on how they contributed to the output (predictions).\n",

        "1. Deploy a `Vertex AI` AutoML or custom tabular model to an `Vertex AI Endpoint`.\n",

        "4. Upload or automatic generation of the `input schema` for parsing.\n",

        "Once configured, you can enable/disable monitoring, change alerts and update the model monitoring configuration. \n",

The input feature values contained in the logged requests are then analyzed for skew or drift on an specified interval basis. You set a sampling rate to monitor a subset of the production inputs to a model, and the monitoring interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model monitoring service needs to know how to parse the feature values, which is referred to as the input schema. For AutoML tabular models, the input schema is automatically generated. For custom tabular models, the service will attempt to automatically derive the input schema from the first 1000 prediction requests. Alternatively, one can upload the input schema.\n",

        "For skew detection, the monitoring service requires a baseline for the statistical distribution of values in the training data. For AutoML tabular models this is automatically derived. For custom tabular models, you upload the training data to the service, and have the service automatically derive the distribution.\n",
