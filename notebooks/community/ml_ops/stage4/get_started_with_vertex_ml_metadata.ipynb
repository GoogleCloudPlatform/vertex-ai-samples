        "The `Vertex ML Metadata` service provides you with the ability to record, and subsequently search and analyze, the artifacts and corresponding metadata produced by your ML workflows. For example, during experimentation one might desire to record the location of the model artifacts, as artifacts, and the training hyperparameters and evaluation metrics as the corresponding metadata.\n",

        "\n",
        "Vertex ML Metadata describes your ML system's metadata as a graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Artifacts**: Artifacts are pieces of data that ML systems consume or produce, such as: datasets, models, or logs. For large artifacts like datasets or models, the artifact record includes the URI where the data is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Executions**: Executions describe a single step in your ML system's workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Events**: Executions can depend on artifacts as inputs or produce artifacts as outputs. Events describe the relationship between artifacts and executions to help you determine the lineage of artifacts. For example, an event is created to record that a dataset is used by an execution, and another event is created to record that this execution produced a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Contexts**: Contexts let you group artifacts and executions together in a single, queryable, and typed category.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ML artifact lineage\n",
        "\n",
        "Vertex ML Metadata provides the ability to understand changes in the performance of your machine ML system, and analyze the metadata produced by your ML workflow and the lineage of its artifacts. An artifact's lineage includes all the factors that contributed to its creation, as well as artifacts and metadata that descend from this artifact.\n",
