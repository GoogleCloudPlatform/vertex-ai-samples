        "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the TabNet builtin algorithm service on the Vertex AI platform to train custom tabular models.\n",
        "\n",
        "TabNet combines the best of two worlds: it is explainable (similar to simpler tree-based models) while benefiting from high performance (similar to deep neural networks). This makes it great for retailers, finance and insurance industry applications such as predicting credit scores, fraud detection and forecasting. \n",
        "\n",
        "TabNet uses a machine learning technique called sequential attention to select which model features to reason from at each step in the model. This mechanism makes it possible to explain how the model arrives at its predictions and helps it learn more accurate models. TabNet not only outperforms other neural networks and decision trees but also provides interpretable feature attributions. \n",

For fast training on large datasets, we suggest deterministic_data=False setting, albeit having randomness in the results (which becomes negligible at large datasets). Note that determinism is still not guaranteed with distributed training, as map-reduce causes randomness due to the ordering of algebraic operations with finite precision. However, this is negligible in practice, especially on large datasets.

For example, if you had one existing model in production with 100% of the traffic, you could deploy a new model to the same endpoint, direct 10% of traffic to it, and reduce the original model's traffic to 90%.
