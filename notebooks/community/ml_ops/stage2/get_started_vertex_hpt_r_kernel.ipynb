    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is [California Housing Dataset](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html). The data contains information from the 1990 California census. The data set is publicly available from Google Cloud Storage at `gs://cloud-samples-data/ai-platform-unified/datasets/tabular/california-housing-tabular-regression.csv`. The dataset is used to train a Random Forest regressor to predict a median housing price, given a longitude and lattitude along with data from the corresponding census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).\n",

    "You can control the job in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_trial_count`: Decide how many trials you want to allow the service to run. Increasing the number of trials generally yields better results, but it is not always so. Usually, there is a point of diminishing returns after which additional trials have little or no effect on the accuracy. Before starting a job with a large number of trials, you may want to start with a small number of trials to gauge the effect your chosen hyperparameters have on your model's accuracy. To get the most out of hyperparameter tuning, you shouldn't set your maximum value lower than ten times the number of hyperparameters you use.\n",
    "- `parallel_trial_count`: You can specify how many trials can run in parallel. Running parallel trials has the benefit of reducing the time the training job takes (real time—the total processing time required is not typically changed). However, running in parallel can reduce the effectiveness of the tuning job overall. That is because hyperparameter tuning uses the results of previous trials to inform the values to assign to the hyperparameters of subsequent trials. When running in parallel, some trials start without having the benefit of the results of any trials still running.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you also need to specify which hyperparameters to tune. There is little universal advice to give about how to choose which hyperparameters you should tune. If you have experience with the machine learning technique that you're using, you may have insight into how its hyperparameters behave. You may also be able to find advice from machine learning communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you choose them, it's important to understand the implications. Every hyperparameter that you choose to tune has the potential to increase the number of trials required for a successful tuning job. When you run a hyperparameter tuning job on Vertex AI, the amount you are charged is based on the duration of the trials initiated by your hyperparameter tuning job. A careful choice of hyperparameters to tune can reduce the time and cost of your hyperparameter tuning job.\n",
