        "### An anatomy of a pipeline component\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's dive a bit into how pipeline components are executed. First, each component is containerized. That is, each component has its own:\n",
        "\n",
        "- container image\n",
        "- installation requirements\n",
        "- (optional) hardware requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "The above affects the amount of time/resources required to provision the component. For example, if each component in the pipeline had a different machine requirement, then a machine would have to be provisioned for each component. Even if the machine type is the same, if each component had a different container image, then a new container image would have to be provisioned for each component.\n",
        "\n",
        "In otherwords, the efficiency of the pipeline is affected by the amount of provisioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, since each component runs in a container with its own memory space, there are performance issues relating to the amount of data moved across the container boundaries -- i.e., marshalling. To marshall data, the data has to be serialized and written to a volume storage, where the next component can access and de-serialize the data. Simple data types like integers, floats, strings, small dictionaries can be efficiently marshalled. You want to avoid though marshalling large memory objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Construction of data pipeline components\n",
        "\n",
        "Both BigQuery and Dataflow deal with data, and more importantly large amounts of data. As a result, you need to carefully consider the construction of the pipeline, so that you are not marshalling large amounts of in-memory data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a task that consists of reading a million records into an in-memory pandas dataframe, and then the in-memory data is processed for statistics. You could write this as two components: one component creates the dataframe, and the other processes it. Sounds good, nice and modular and the first component is likely reusable. Bad choice though.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you did construct the components this way, the first component would have to write the dataframe to a disk, and the second component would then have to read it back from disk. Very inefficient. If you need a large in-memory object, one should only create it in the same component where it is used. In this example, one would create a single component to create and process the dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's now consider Vertex AI resources like datasets, models and endpoints. These resources have a physical manifestation which may include a combination of data and binary files. The Vertex AI resource object is not the actual files, but a in-memory wrapper. The resource object consists of properties and method, and file data is not read into memory until a property/method needs it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, for efficiency purposes, Vertex AI was designed with reference identifiers. One can load these resource wrappers via the resource identifier. Thus, when creating or otherwise referencing resource objects between components, one passes the resource identifier(s) between components."
