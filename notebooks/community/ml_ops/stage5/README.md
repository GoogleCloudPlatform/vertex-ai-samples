# Stage 5: Deployment

## Purpose

Configure compute and networking requirements for containerized serving binaries for a production load.


## Recommendations  

The fifth stage in MLOps is deployment to production of the blessed model, which will replace the previous blessed model in production. This stage may be done entirely by MLOps. We recommend:

- Deploy the blessed model from the Vertex Model Registry.
- Use the Google Container Registry for the deployment container.
- Attach, if any, serving function from the Vertex Model Registry to the deployed model.
- Use Vertex Pipelines for the deployment.
- For cloud models, deploy within the Google Cloud infrastructure.
- Use Vertex Prediction traffic split for production rollout.
- Use Vertex Prediction to set your criteria for scaling and load balancing.

## Notebooks

### Get Started


[Get started with Vertex AI Endpoints](get_started_with_vertex_endpoints.ipynb)

```
The steps include:

- Creating an `Endpoint` resource.
- List all `Endpoint` resources.
- List `Endpoint` resources by query filter.
- Configuring the serving binary of a `Model` resource for deployment to an `Endpoint` resource.
- Deploying a single `Model` resource to an `Endpoint` resource.
- Get deployment settings for a deployed `Model` resource.
- Configuring auto-scaling.
- Deploying multiple `Model` resources to an `Endpoint` resource and configuring a traffic split.
- Dynamically change the traffic split for an `Endpoint` resource.
- Undeploy a single `Model` resource to an `Endpoint` resource.
- Undeploy all `Model` resources from an `Endpoint` resource.
- Delete an `Endpoint` resource.
- In pipeline: Create an `Endpoint` resource and deploy an existing `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource.
- In pipeline: Deploy an existing `Model` resource to an existing `Endpoint` resource.
```

[Get started with Vertex AI Private Endpoints](get_started_with_vertex_private_endpoints.ipynb)

```
The steps performed include:

- Creating a `Private Endpoint` resource.
- Configure a VPC peering connection.
- Configuring the serving binary of a `Model` resource for deployment to a `Private Endpoint` resource.
- Deploying a `Model` resource to a `Private Endpoint` resource.
- Send a prediction request to a `Private Endpoint`
```
