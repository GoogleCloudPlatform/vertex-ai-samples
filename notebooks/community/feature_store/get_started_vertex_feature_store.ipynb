    "Let's assume you have a recommendation model that predicts a coupon to print on the back of a cash register receipt. Now, if that model was trained only on single transaction instances (what was bought and how much), then (in the past) you use an Apriori algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we have historical data on the customer (say it's indexed by credit card number). Like total purchases to date, average purchase per transaction, frequency of purchase by product category, etc. We use this \"enriched data\" to train a recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to do a live prediction. You get a transaction from the cash register, but all it has is the credit card number and this transaction. It does not have the enriched data the model needs. During serving, the credit card number is used as an index to Feature Store to get the enriched data needed for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, let's say the enriched data the model was trained on was timestamped on June 1st. The current transaction is from June 15th. Assume that the user has made other transactions between June 1st and 15th, and the enriched data has been continuously updated in Feature Store. But the model was trained on June 1st data. Feature Store knows the version number and serves the June 1st version to the model (not the current June 15th). Otherwise, if you used June 15th data, you would have training-serving skew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem here is the data drift. Things change and suddenly one day, everybody is buying toilet paper! There is a significant change in the distribution of existing enriched data from the distribution that the deployed model was trained on. Feature Store can detect changes/thresholds in distribution changes and trigger a notification for retraining the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "To be more specific, the ground-truth observation is described in Table 1 and the desired dataset is described in Table 2. Each row in Table 2 is a result of joining the imported feature values from Vertex AI Feature Store according to the entity IDs and timestamps in Table 1.
