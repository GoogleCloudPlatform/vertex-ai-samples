        "Now it's time to do a live prediction. You get a transaction from the cash register, but all it has is the credit card number and this transaction. It does not have the enriched data the model needs. During serving, the credit card number is used as an index to Feature Store to get the enriched data needed for the model.\n",

Assume that the user has made other transactions between June 1st and 15th, and the enriched data has been continuously updated in Feature Store. But the model was trained on June 1st data. Feature Store knows the version number and serves the June 1st version to the model (not the current June 15th). Otherwise, if you used June 15th data, you would have training-serving skew.\n",

There is a significant change in the distribution of existing enriched data from the distribution that the deployed model was trained on.
