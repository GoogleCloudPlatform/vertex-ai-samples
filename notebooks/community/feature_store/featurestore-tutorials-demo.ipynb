    "This Colab assumes that you understand basic Google Cloud concepts such as [Project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects), [Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs). Some machine learning knowledge is also helpful but not required.\n",

    "This Colab uses an ecommerce dataset as an example throughout all the sessions. The task is to train a model to recommend products for a user based on the ratings. \n",

    "The dataset used in this notebook consists of order items data since 2018 for an online ecommerce store. This dataset is publicly available at bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items Big-Query table which can be accessed by pinning the bigquery-public-data project in BigQuery. The table consists of various fields related to each of the order items like the order_id, product_id, user_id, status, and price when it is created when it has been shipped, etc. Among these fields, the current\n",

Each row in Table 2 is a result of joining the imported feature values from Vertex AI Feature Store according to the entity IDs and timestamps in Table 1. In this example,  the `product_id` and `rating` features from `users` are chosen to batch train. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create an `Endpoint` resource for deploying the `Model` resource.\n",
    "2. Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `deployed_model_display_name`: A human-readable name for the deployed model.\n",
    "- `traffic_split`: Percent of traffic at the endpoint that goes to this model, which is specified as a dictionary of one or more key/value pairs.\n",
    "   - If only one model, then specify `{ \"0\": 100 }`, where \"0\" refers to this model being uploaded and 100 means 100% of the traffic.\n",
    "   - If there are existing models on the endpoint, for which the traffic will be split, then use `model_id` to specify `{ \"0\": percent, model_id: percent, ... }`, where `model_id` is the ID of an existing `DeployedModel` on the endpoint. The percentages must add up to 100.\n",
    "- `machine_type`: The type of machine to use for training.\n",
    "- `accelerator_type`: The hardware accelerator type.\n",
    "- `accelerator_count`: The number of accelerators to attach to a worker replica.\n",
    "- `starting_replica_count`: The number of compute instances to initially provision.\n",
    "- `max_replica_count`: The maximum number of compute instances to scale to. In this tutorial, only one instance is provisioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traffic split\n",
    "\n",
    "The `traffic_split` parameter is specified as a Python dictionary. You can deploy more than one instance of your model to an endpoint, and then set the percentage of traffic that goes to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a traffic split to introduce a new model gradually into production. For example, if you had one existing model in production with 100% of the traffic, you could deploy a new model to the same endpoint, direct 10% of traffic to it, and reduce the original model's traffic to 90%. This allows you to monitor the new model's performance while minimizing the disruption to the majority of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compute instance scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a single instance (or node) to serve your online prediction requests. This tutorial uses a single node, so the variables `MIN_NODES` and `MAX_NODES` are both set to `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use multiple nodes to serve your online prediction requests, set `MAX_NODES` to the maximum number of nodes you want to use. Vertex AI auto-scales the number of nodes used to serve your predictions, up to the maximum number you set. Refer to the [pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#prediction-prices) to understand the costs of autoscaling with multiple nodes.\n",
