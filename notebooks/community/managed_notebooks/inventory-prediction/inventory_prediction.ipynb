Further, there are also steps included in this notebook to deploy the model on Vertex AI using the Vertex AI sdk and analyze the deployed model using the [What-If tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/).\n",

        "The dataset used in this notebook consists of inventory data since 2018 for an online ecommerce store. This dataset is publicly available at `looker-private-demo.ecomm.inventory_items` BigQuery table which can be accessed by pinning the `looker-private-demo` project in BigQuery. The table consists of various fields related to each of the inventory items like the item's `id`,`product_id`, price, when it came to the inventory, when it has been sold etc. Among these fields, the current notebook makes use of the following fields assuming their purpose is as described below :\n",
        "\n",
        "- `id`: The Id of the inventory item.\n",
        "- `product_id`: The Id of the product.\n",
        "- `created_at`: When the item has arrived at the inventory/store.\n",
        "- `sold_at`: When the item was sold(*Null if still unsold*).\n",
        "- `cost`: Cost at which the item was sold.\n",
        "- `product_category`: Category of the product.\n",
        "- `product_brand`: Brand of the product (dropped later as there are too many values).\n",
        "- `product_retail_price`: Price of of the product.\n",
        "- `product_department`: Department to which the product belongs to.\n",
        "- `product_distribution_center_id`: Which distribution center(probably region) the product is being sold from.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset can be found encoded already to hide any private information of the store. For example, the distribution centers have been assigned ids ranging from 1-10.\n",

        "In the **Datapoint editor** tab, you can highlight a dot in the result set and ask the What If tool to pick the \"nearest counterfactual\". This is a row of data closest to the row of data you selected but with the opposite outcome. Features in the left-hand table are editable and can show what tweaks are needed to get a particular row of data to flip from one outcome to another. For example, altering the *discount_percentage* feature would show how it impacts the prediction. \n",

        "Under the **Performance & Fairness** tab, you can slice the prediction results by a second variable. This allows digging deeper and understanding how different segments of the data react to the model's predictions.  For example, in the following image, the higher the *discount_percentage*, the lesser the false negatives and the lower the *discount_percentage*, the higher the false positives. \n",
