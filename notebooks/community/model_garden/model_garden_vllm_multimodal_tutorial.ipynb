        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 have revolutionized AI, showcasing impressive abilities in text generation, language translation, and knowledge retrieval. Now, with the advent of multimodal models, LLMs can process and understand not only text but also visual inputs, creating an entirely new dimension of interaction. However, effectively deploying and serving these models often requires specialized infrastructure and optimized serving strategies. This is where **vLLM** steps in, transforming how we interact with these complex models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a traditional server trying to handle both a text and image simultaneously: it's akin to a single lane road trying to accommodate both cars and trucks at once, resulting in a significant slowdown. vLLM, on the other hand, acts as a multi-lane highway, efficiently processing diverse inputs to maximize throughput and minimize latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**vLLM** is more than just an optimization; it's a paradigm shift. This open-source library revolutionizes LLM serving, and it's especially designed for the newest challenges of Multimodal LLMs by:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Democratizing Access to Multimodal LLMs:** Enabling efficient and cost-effective deployment of powerful multimodal models like Llama 3.2, even on limited hardware. This is akin to giving you a specialized vehicle that can navigate both asphalt roads and challenging terrains seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Boosting Multimodal Throughput:** Maximizing the number of requests, whether text-only or mixed media, handled per second, guaranteeing responsive interactions. vLLM's optimized architecture ensures that your model keeps pace with even the most demanding multimodal workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Enabling Dynamic Customization:** Supporting dynamic LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), allowing you to fine-tune model behavior on-the-fly without the need for retraining the entire model. This is like having interchangeable attachments for a versatile tool, each designed for different jobs, allowing you to fine tune for the current context without needing to swap the tool entirely.\n",

        "*   **Feature Enhancements:**\n",
        "    *   **Dynamic LoRA with Enhanced Caching and GCS Support:** Extends dynamic LoRA capabilities with local disk caching mechanisms and robust error handling, alongside support for loading LoRA weights directly from GCS paths and signed URLs, simplifying management and deployment of customized models.\n",
        "    *   **OpenAI Chat Completions API Compatibility:**  Provides seamless integration with the widely adopted OpenAI Chat Completions API, enabling straightforward migration and utilization of existing OpenAI-compatible applications.\n",
        "    *   **Llama 3.1/3.2 Function Calling Parsing:** Implements specialized parsing for Llama 3.1/3.2 function calling, facilitating advanced interactions and tool utilization within multimodal applications.\n",
        "    *   **Llama 3.2 Validation for Non-Leading Images** Ensures the correct processing of Llama3.2 image modalities.\n",
