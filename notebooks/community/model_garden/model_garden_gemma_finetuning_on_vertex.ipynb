        "This notebook demonstrates finetuning and deploying Gemma models with [Vertex AI Custom Training Job](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/create-custom-job). All of the examples in this notebook use parameter efficient finetuning methods [PEFT (LoRA)](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) to reduce training and storage costs. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is one approach of Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), where pretrained model weights are frozen and rank decomposition matrices representing the change in model weights are trained during finetuning. Read more about LoRA in the following publication: [Hu, E.J., Shen, Y., Wallis, P., Allen-Zhu, Z., Li, Y., Wang, S., Wang, L. and Chen, W., 2021.

This may include improvements to existing algorithms, as well as the development of new architectures that are better suited to specific types of data and tasks. Increased use of AI in healthcare: AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, by improving the accuracy of diagnoses, developing new treatments, and personalizing patient care. We can expect to see continued investment in this area, with more healthcare providers and researchers using AI to improve patient outcomes. Greater automation in the workplace: Automation is already transforming many industries, and AI is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process. We can expect to see more jobs being automated, as well as the development of new types of jobs that require a combination of human and machine skills. More natural and intuitive interactions with technology: As AI becomes more advanced, we can expect to see more natural and intuitive ways of interacting with technology. This may include voice and gesture recognition, as well as more sophisticated chatbots and virtual assistants. Increased focus on ethical considerations: As AI becomes more powerful, there will be a growing need to consider its ethical implications. This may include issues such as bias in AI algorithms, the impact of automation on employment, and the use of AI in surveillance and policing. Overall, the future of AI in 10 years is likely to be shaped by a combination of technological advancements, societal changes, and ethical considerations. While there are many exciting possibilities for AI in the future, it will be important to carefully consider its potential impact on society and to work towards ensuring that its benefits are shared fairly and equitably.\n",
