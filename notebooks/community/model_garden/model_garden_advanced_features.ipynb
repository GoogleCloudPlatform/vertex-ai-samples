        "\n",
        "Model optimization has emerged as a crucial step, allowing customers to balance cost-effectiveness, throughput and latency performance. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to deliver optimal performance for every customer. Even with the same model, the variation can occur as user traffic patterns and requirements may vary for different customers. For example, for chat applications, minimizing latency is key to offer an interactive experience, whereas other applications like recommendations may require maximizing throughput.\n",

        "\n",
        "Prefix caching reuses computations from previously generated text, eliminating redundant processing. It’s a popular technique to reduce Time-To-First-Token for requests with common prompt prefixes.

        "\n",
        "Serving large LLM could be slow, and speculative decoding is a very effective optimization technique to reduce generation Time-Per-Output-Token latency. The standard LLM would generate tokens one-by-one sequentially with autoregressive decoding. In contrast, with speculative decoding, we use a fast drafter to efficiently guess multiple tokens and then utilize the larger LLM to verify them in parallel.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Caching in GPU Memory\n",
        "OSS vLLM provides an option to enable GPU memory prefix kv caching. The GPU memory cache is fast yet relatively small in size. For example, if using a3-high-gpu-4g VM (with 4xH100_80G) to serve a Llama3.1-70B model, the capacity for GPU cache size will be capped below 180GB (320GB - 140GB (model weight)).\n",
        "### Caching in VM Host Memory\n",
        "Vertex Model Garden’s prebuilt vLLM additionally supports caching prefix kv in the VM host memory. Caching in VM host memory is not as fast as caching in GPU memory. On cache hit, the cached kv state needs to be transferred from host memory to GPU memory before it can be reused by the LLM computation. However, the host memory cache is larger in size, allowing more data to be cached and therefore improving Time to First Token (TTFT). Same example: using a3-high-gpu-4g VM to serve a Llama3.1-70B model, the capacity for the host memory cache can be up to 936 GB.\n",
        "\n",
        "When host memory kv cache is enabled, the processed requests’ kv state will be written to both GPU cache and host cache. The write-to-host-memory-cache operation runs asynchronously in the background, without hurting the performance of vLLM inference requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "We benchmarked workloads without common prefixes (each request has ~3k tokens prompt, ~250 output-tokens): the extra write-to-host-memory-cache operation has **<2%** impact on latency of inference requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also benchmarked workloads that cache-miss in GPU cache and cache-hit in host cache with various prompt-lengths (1k-3k), number-of-concurrent-requests (1-30), and cache-hit-ratio (50%-100%), and see **20-75%** TTFT improvement. For example: For Llama3-1-8B, with 1 concurrent-request, 3k-tokens prompt’s TTFT improves by 43%, if fully cached in the host memory cache. For Llama3-1-70B, the improvement is 57%. The observed TTFT improvement grows with longer cached prompt prefixes and higher system load.\n"

        "Speculative decoding is an algorithm to sample from autoregressive models faster without any changes to the outputs, by computing several tokens in parallel using a drafter. The algorithm is based on 2 core ideas:\n",
        "- A smaller and faster drafter can approximate the target model well enough.\n",
        "- The target model can verify multiple drafter outputs in parallel, generating several tokens concurrently without changing the output distribution or model architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "How the algorithm works:\n",
        "- A small but much faster drafter efficiently proposes multiple tokens\n",
        "- Target model verifies all these tokens in one single model forward pass. If target model output differs from the drafted tokens, the first different token and the following ones are rejected\n",
        "- This approach can significantly reduce latency without compromising the response quality. For greedy sampling, it's clear that the target model output distribution remains unchanged. For non greedy sampling, we use a [modified rejection sampling algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01318) to recover the target model distribution which theoretically guarantees the output distribution remains the same\n",

        "Vertex prebuilt vLLM container supports the following speculation methods:\n",
        "-  Draft model: The most popular drafter is to use a smaller LLM model that autoregressively generates multiple tokens. Speculation with draft models offers good quality/accuracy, but it requires training or identifying a drafter model that closely aligns with the target LLM\n",
        "- N-gram: N-gram matching is an extremely simple method, the good thing about it is it doesn't require any model, and it could still work well for input grounded generation where there is a significant overlap between the prompt and the answer. This could be entity names, phrases, or code chunks that the LLM directly copies from the input while generating the output. So N-gram is suitable for tasks like context based question answering, code editing, etc.\n",
