        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to leveraging [Spot VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot) and [Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/use-reservations#get-predictions) for deploying a fully managed Vertex AI endpoint. The process involves configuring a reservation—a dedicated pool of compute resources—that can help ensure cost stability and resource availability for your inference workloads. You will learn how to create, view, and manage these reservations to control how your endpoints consume underlying resources. By following these instructions, you will gain a deep understanding of how the Vertex AI ecosystem can be tuned to your workload requirements, achieving an optimal balance of cost-effectiveness and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will cover how to:\n",
        "1. **Deploy an Endpoint Using a Spot VM**: Deploy endpoints automatically on preempted resources (if capacity is available).\n",
        "2. **Create a Single-Project Reservation:** Establish a dedicated pool of compute resources reserved solely for your current project.\n",
        "3. **Grant Permissions to Google Cloud Services:** Ensure that the necessary Google Cloud services can access and utilize these reservations securely and transparently.\n",
        "4. **Deploy a Vertex AI Endpoint Using Reservations:** Harness the full potential of reserved resources to deploy an endpoint that benefits from predictable performance and cost stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon completion, you will not only know how to set up and use reservations for a Vertex AI endpoint, but you will also possess the insights needed to adapt these techniques to a variety of production scenarios. For an even broader understanding of reservations and to explore additional reservation configurations, refer to the [Compute Engine Reservations Overview](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reservations-overview).\n",

        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will utilize the `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B` model running on [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) as a concrete example. This allows you to experiment with state-of-the-art language modeling within a well-defined environment. Throughout the process, we will delve into every aspect of setting up, managing, and cleaning up a complete end-to-end deployment pipeline using Vertex AI and reservations.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following along, you will learn how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Set Up a Google Cloud Project:** Configure your environment and ensure that all prerequisites—such as APIs, billing, and IAM roles—are properly in place.\n",
        "- **Configure Deployment Utilities:** Prepare and manage essential tools and scripts that streamline endpoint creation, testing, and maintenance.\n",
        "- **Deploy an Endpoint Using a Spot VM:** Achieve cost savings by running inference workloads on preemptible resources while maintaining service integrity.\n",
        "- **Create and Manage Reservations:** Establish a dedicated pool of compute resources, ensuring that your endpoints can maintain consistent performance without competing for capacity.\n",
        "- **View and Verify Reservations:** Inspect your reservations to confirm that resources are correctly allocated and ready for consumption by your endpoints.\n",
        "- **Consume Reservations as Instances:** Utilize the reserved resources to run your endpoints, guaranteeing predictable performance and capacity.\n",
        "- **Deploy Endpoints with `ANY_RESERVATION` and `SPECIFIC_RESERVATION` Policies:** Gain granular control over how your endpoints source their compute resources, whether by tapping into any available reservation or by targeting a specific one for tighter control.\n",
        "- **Delete Reservations and Endpoints:** Cleanly remove resources to maintain a tidy and cost-efficient environment, ensuring that unused capacity does not incur ongoing costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this tutorial, you will have developed a thorough, in-depth understanding of how to combine Spot VMs, reservations, and Vertex AI to create a flexible, efficient, and cost-conscious inference infrastructure.\n",

        "# @markdown **What are Spot VMs?**  [Spot VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot) are spare compute instances offered by Google Cloud at significantly discounted rates. Unlike standard on-demand VMs, Spot VMs provide lower prices—often as much as 60-91% off the regular cost for most machine types and GPUs—making them extremely cost-effective for certain workloads. However, the trade-off is that these VMs can be preempted (stopped) by Google Cloud at any time if the capacity is needed elsewhere. As a result, Spot VMs are best suited for workloads that are resilient to interruptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown **Stockouts and Resource Availability:**  Even with the correct quotas, you may encounter **stockouts**, which occur when the requested resources (such as a specific VM family, shape, or disk type) are temporarily unavailable. This situation can lead to delays or increased costs if you opt for alternative resource configurations. For more insights into handling capacity constraints and stockouts, refer to the [Capacity, Quota, and Stockouts resource guide](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blogs/Managing-Capacity-Quota-and-Stockouts-in-the-Cloud-Concepts-and/ba-p/464770#toc-hId-1635110264).\n",

If a stockout prevents you from acquiring standard VMs, a Spot VM can serve as a cost-effective and readily available fallback. While preemptions can occur, if your model inference or training jobs can tolerate being paused or restarted, this approach can greatly reduce compute costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown - **Use Reservations:**  Another way to ensure predictable resource availability is to use [Reservations](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/use-reservations#get-predictions), which guarantee that certain resources remain allocated for your workloads. Although not as cost-effective as Spot VMs, reservations can alleviate the uncertainty caused by stockouts, ensuring that you always have enough capacity for your deployments.\n",

        "# @markdown - **Fault-Tolerant and Interruptible:**  If your workloads can handle interruptions—such as batch processing jobs that can resume after a delay or distributed training jobs that can adjust to losing certain workers—a Spot VM’s lower cost can result in significant savings over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "# @markdown In addition to using Spot VMs, another robust strategy to mitigate capacity issues and avoid stockouts is to leverage resource **reservations**. A reservation is a powerful Compute Engine feature that guarantees the availability of certain machine and accelerator resources within a specific zone, ensuring your Vertex AI endpoints can scale predictably. Unlike relying on transient or best-effort resources, reservations grant you a higher level of certainty that the infrastructure you need will be ready when you need it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown **Key Advantages of Reservations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown 1. **Predictable Capacity:**\n",
        "# @markdown By reserving capacity ahead of time, you ensure that resources (such as specific GPU types) remain available. This is particularly valuable when deploying models at scale or handling peak workloads that demand consistent performance and availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown 2. **Simplified Scaling and Migration:**\n",
        "# @markdown Reservations facilitate scaling up your deployments without capacity surprises. They also help with planned migrations or transitioning to new hardware configurations, minimizing downtime and resource contention.\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown 3. **Disaster Recovery Preparedness:**\n",
        "# @markdown In the event of failures or the need for rapid failover, having pre-reserved resources enables you to spin up new endpoints quickly in the designated zone. This capability enhances the resiliency and reliability of your Vertex AI services.\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown ### Current Support for GPU Reservations in Vertex AI\n",
        "\n",
        "# @markdown It’s crucial to note that, as of now, **only GPU reservations are supported in Vertex AI**. This limitation means that if your workloads rely on GPU-accelerated inference, reservations can ensure that the required GPUs are consistently available. If you’re running GPU-intensive machine learning tasks like large language model inference, image recognition, or video processing, GPU reservations can be a game changer in maintaining stable and predictable performance.\n",
