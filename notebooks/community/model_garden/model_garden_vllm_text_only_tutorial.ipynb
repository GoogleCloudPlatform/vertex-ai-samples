        "## Deploy prebuilt Llama 3.1 8B Instruct with standard vLLM and Fast Deployment\n",
        "\n",
        "Before diving into the code, let's understand the arguments provided to the `fast_deploy` function and the subsequent `aiplatform.Model.upload` and `model.deploy` calls within it. These arguments configure how the model is uploaded to Vertex AI and deployed for serving.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Arguments Explained:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**`fast_deploy` function arguments:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `publisher` *(str)*: The name of the model publisher. This indicates the organization or entity that provides the model (e.g., \"meta\").\n",
        "*   `publisher_model_id` *(str)*: The identifier of the model within the publisher's catalog (e.g., \"llama3_1\").\n",
        "*   `version_id` *(str)*: The specific version of the model to be deployed (e.g., \"llama-3.1-8b-instruct\"). This allows for tracking and selecting particular model iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Arguments for `aiplatform.Model.upload` (inside `fast_deploy`):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `display_name` *(str)*: The name that will be shown in the Vertex AI Model Registry. This helps identify the uploaded model in the Vertex AI console. It's automatically set based on the model from the model garden.\n",
        "*   `serving_container_image_uri` *(str)*: The location of the container image that will be used for serving the model. Typically this would be a pre-built image from a container registry that includes the necessary libraries and tools to run the model.\n",
        "*    `serving_container_args` *(list)*: Command-line arguments passed to the container when it starts, if needed by the containerized application.\n",
        "*   `serving_container_environment_variables` *(dict)*: Environment variables that are set within the serving container. This is commonly used to configure model parameters, resource limits, and other operational settings. These are equivalent to text-generation-inference environment variables, which are in turn equivalent to the arguments for the text-generation-launcher. The Hugging Face DLCs for TGI also capture the `AIP_` environment variables as specified in the [Vertex AI Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#environment-variables).\n",
        "*   `serving_container_ports` *(list of int)*: The port number where the Vertex AI endpoint will be exposed within the container. By default, this is 8080.\n",
        "*   `serving_container_predict_route` *(str)*: The route used for the prediction endpoint in the container.\n",
        "*   `serving_container_health_route` *(str)*: The route used for the health check endpoint in the container.\n",
        "*  `serving_container_shared_memory_size_mb` *(int)*: Sets the shared memory size in megabytes for the container.\n",
        "*   `serving_container_deployment_timeout` *(int)*: Time in seconds before the deployment request will timeout.\n",
        "*   `model_garden_source_model_name` *(str)*: The full path to the source model that is being deployed. This information is useful for tracking lineage of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Arguments for `model.deploy` (inside `fast_deploy`):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `endpoint` *(aiplatform.Endpoint)*: The Vertex AI endpoint where the model will be deployed.\n",
        "*   `machine_type` *(str)*: The type of virtual machine to use for prediction (e.g., `n1-standard-8`, `a2-highgpu-1g`).\n",
        "*   `accelerator_type` *(str)*: The type of GPU accelerator to use for prediction (e.g., `NVIDIA_TESLA_A100`, `NVIDIA_L4`).\n",
        "*   `accelerator_count` *(int)*: The number of GPU accelerators to use for prediction.\n",
        "*   `deploy_request_timeout` *(int)*: The maximum time in seconds to wait for the deployment request to complete.\n",
        "*   `disable_container_logging` *(bool)*: A flag to disable container logging.\n",
        "*    `fast_tryout_enabled` *(bool)*: A flag to enable a faster tryout deployment of the endpoint.\n",
        "*   `system_labels` *(dict)*:  Labels to attach to the deployed model. The code adds two specific labels here, \"DEPLOY_SOURCE\" to \"notebook\" and  \"NOTEBOOK_NAME\" with the name of the current notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts and Considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Containerization:** The model is packaged into a container image, ensuring consistency across different environments. The `serving_container_image_uri` specifies the location of this container image.\n",
        "*   **Environment Variables:** These allow you to customize the serving behavior of your model without modifying the container image itself. This is very important for configuring specific model settings, and passing credentials.\n",
        "*   **Resource Allocation:** The `machine_type`, `accelerator_type`, and `accelerator_count` arguments control the compute resources dedicated to your deployed model.\n",
        "*   **Endpoint:** The endpoint is the access point for making predictions using your deployed model.\n",
        "*   **Model Garden:** This model is being deployed from Google's Model Garden, which includes pre-trained models that can be deployed in Vertex AI.\n",
        "*   **Dedicated Endpoint:** The `dedicated_endpoint_enabled=True` argument in `aiplatform.Endpoint.create()`  forces the endpoint to be dedicated which is required for fast deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "By carefully configuring these arguments, you can tailor your model deployment to meet your specific performance, cost, and operational requirements."
