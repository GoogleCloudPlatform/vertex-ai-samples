        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to (1) single-model multi-replica serving, and (2) multi-model serving with dynamic loading and unloading. For single-model multi-replica serving, the notebook demonstrates a container-level solution using the Model Garden container and an infrastructure-level solution using pod co-scheduling and NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG). For multi-model serving, the notebook demonstrates a container-level solution using the Model Garden container. The notebook additionally demonstrates how to find the optimal serving recipe using a benchmark utility.\n",

We will then deploy the winning recipe to a Vertex AI Endpoint.\n",

        "**Pipeline Parallelism** splits a model's layers into sequential stages, placing each stage on a different GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Analogy 🚗:** Think of a car manufacturing assembly line. GPU 1 (Station 1) installs the engine (processes layers 1-16), then passes the car to GPU 2 (Station 2) to add the chassis (processes layers 17-32), and so on. A request \"moves\" from one GPU to the next until it's complete.\n",
        "* **Use Case:** Useful for serving a model that doesn't fit onto a single GPU and especially multi-host serving of large models. Its main drawback is potential GPU idle time, as later stages must wait for the first ones to finish (known as the \"pipeline bubble\"), and potential uneven allocation of layers across GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Tensor Parallelism (TP): The Chef Team**\n",
        "**Tensor Parallelism** splits individual layers—and the mathematical operations within them—across multiple GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Analogy 🍕:** Imagine several chefs (GPUs) working on a single, enormous pizza (a single model layer) at the same time. Each chef is responsible for a slice, and they must communicate constantly to ensure the toppings are distributed perfectly.\n",
        "* **Use Case:** Useful for serving a model that doesn't fit onto a single GPU and can reduce inference latency by splitting large tensor computations into smaller components. It introduces communication overhead during per-layer computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Model Replicas (vLLM Instances): Multiple Kitchens**\n",
        "A **Model Replica** is a full, independent copy of the vLLM server instance. If a model can fit on a subset of your available GPUs, you can run multiple replicas to handle more users at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Analogy 👨‍🍳:** Instead of building one giant, complex kitchen (a single large model instance), you open several smaller, independent kitchens (replicas). Each kitchen can take a customer's order and fulfill it from start to finish without waiting for the others.\n",
        "* **Use Case:** This is the primary strategy to maximize throughput.\n",
        "\n",
        "✨ **Special Feature**: The Vertex AI Model Garden vLLM container used in this section allows you to run **multiple independent vLLM server instances (replicas) as one container**. This feature is specifically designed to maximize throughput for high-concurrency applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Model Size**: Larger models require a minimum setting of **TP** and/or **PP** to fit the weights into memory. In addition, duplication of their model weights in model replicas creates larger overhead in memory usage. Smaller models can fit onto a single GPU, allowing more possible combinations of **PP**, **TP** and **Model Replica** settings, and duplication of their model weights creates less overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Input and Output Length**: The input length and output length of requests affect the prefill and decode time it takes to process the requests, and the server's compute and memory usage patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Concurrency**: The concurrency of requests, the number of requests running or queued at the server, also affects the server's compute and memory usage patterns. It is a key factor to the latency and throughput tradeoff of the server.\n",
        "\n",

At larger concurrencies, having multiple model replicas gives the best performance. As the concurrency increases, the optimal recipe shifts from `TP=8` to having gradually smaller `TP=4, TP=2, TP=1` and gradually more model replicas of 2, 4, and 8. |\n",

Meanwhile, with a larger model, the concurrency thresholds at which we should have more model replicas increase. In other words, the optimal recipe has comparatively fewer model replicas. With a larger model, there is more memory overhead with having copies of the model weights. |\n",

With a large model that doesn't fit onto one GPU, there are fewer possible combinations of serving strategies. In addition, empirically we find that using tensor parallelism and model replicas offer better performance than pipeline parallelism. |\n",

        "In production environments, the list of models required often changes based on traffic patterns, A/B tests, or new model releases. For multi-model serving, the vLLM model co-hosting server enables users to dynamically adjust the models served through a configuration file stored in a GCS bucket.\n",

        "- Loading/Updating: Models present in the new configuration are loaded. If a model was already running and its configuration (e.g. GPU memory partition, parallelism) is unchanged, the existing running instance is reused. If the configuration has changed, or the model is entirely new, new model instances are initialized.\n",

        "### Estimating GPU Memory Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are two effective methods to estimate the GPU memory needed for your model:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Quick Heuristic: Parameter Count and Precision\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest way to estimate the minimum memory required to hold the model weights is by using the model's parameter count and its floating-point precision (bits per parameter).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core formula is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Memory (GB)} \\approx \\text{Parameter Count in Billion} \\times \\frac{\\text{Bits per Parameter}}{8 \\text{ Bits per Byte}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Common precision types:\n",
        "\n",
        "- FP32 (Full Precision): 32 bits per parameter (4 bytes/param).\n",
        "- BF16 / FP16 (Half Precision): 16 bits per parameter (2 bytes/param).\n",
        "- INT8 / NF4 (Quantized): 8 or 4 bits per parameter (1 or 0.5 bytes/param).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For a model like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (8 billion parameters) stored in BF16 (16 bits/parameter):\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Memory} \\approx 8 \\text{ Billion Parameters} \\times \\frac{16 \\text{ Bits per Parameter}}{8 \\text{ Bits per Byte}} \\approx 16 \\text{ GB}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: This estimate accounts only for the static model weights (the \"cold\" memory). The model server requires additional memory for KV Cache (Key-Value Cache), inference working memory, and GPU overhead (the \"hot\" memory). Therefore, the total memory required for a running instance will always be higher than this minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Using the Vertex AI Model Garden SDK for Verified Configurations\n",
        "\n",
        "Another method is to query the Vertex AI Model Garden using the SDK. This provides concrete, verified deployment configurations for the model, including recommended `machine_type` and `accelerator_count`, which reflects the memory needed for optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Step 2.1: List Deployable Models\n",
        "\n",
        "List the target model or a model of similar size as the target model:\n",

        "vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=\"us-central1\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# List deployable models, optionally list Hugging Face models only or filter by model name.\n",
        "# Here we filter for models related to \"gemma\"\n",
        "print(\"Listing deployable models matching filter 'gemma'...\")\n",
        "deployable_models = model_garden.list_deployable_models(list_hf_models=False, model_filter=\"gemma\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Print up to 10 matching model IDs\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Step 2.2: Fetch Recommended Deployment Options\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have the model ID, retrieve its recommended deployment options. This response shows the machine specifications—including the GPU count and type—that Model Garden recommends for serving the model.\n",
        "\n",
