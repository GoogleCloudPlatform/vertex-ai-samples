The latent code is represented as a tensor of shape [1, 12, 512]. The second dimension of the latent code tensor is called the layer. The face stylizer mixes the learned style and raw face images by generating a weighted sum of the two latent codes on the swap layers. The swap layers are therefore integers within [1, 12]. The more layers are set, the more style will be applied to the output image. Although there is no explicit mapping between the style semantics and the layer index, the shallow layers, e.g. 8, 9, represent the global features of the face, while the deep layers, e.g. 10, 11, represent the fine-grained features of the face. The output stylized image is sensitive to the setting of swap layers. By default, it is set to [8, 9, 10, 11].\n",
        "* **Learning rate and epochs:** Use `learning_rate` and epochs` to specify the these two hyperparameters. learning_rate is set to 4e-4 by default. epochs defines the number of iterations to fine-tune the BlazeStyleGAN model and are set to 100 by default. The lower the learning rate is, the greater the epochs is expected to retrain the model to converge.\n",
        "* **Batch size:** The `batch_size` is used to define the number of latent code samples we sample around the latent code extracted by the encoder with the input image. The batch of latent codes are used to fine-tune the decoder. The greater the batch size usually yield to better performance. It is also limited by the hardware memory. For A100 GPU, the maximum batch size is 8. For P100 and T4 GPU, the maximum batch size is 2.\n",
