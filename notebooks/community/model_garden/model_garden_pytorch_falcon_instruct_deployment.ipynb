The term also encompasses a wide range of vehicles, including motorboats, trains, and aircrafts. Cars typically have four wheels, a cabin for passengers, and an engine or motor. They have been around since the early 19th century and are now one of the most popular forms of transportation, used for daily commuting, shopping, and other purposes.\n",
